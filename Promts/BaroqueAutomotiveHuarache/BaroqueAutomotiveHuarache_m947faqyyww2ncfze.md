  <Goal>Generate a hyperrealistic, Baroque-style image of a Lamborghini Huracán featuring a rug-patterned print, incorporating a "Creation of Adam"-inspired rooftop design showing a Nike Huarache-clad foot pressing the gas pedal. The overall aesthetic should emphasize Italian elegance and luxury.</Goal>
  <Context>
    The user envisions a striking visual that blends automotive design (Lamborghini Huracán), classical art (specifically the Baroque period and "The Creation of Adam"), and contemporary sportswear (Nike Huarache). The image should be photorealistic, detailed, and evoke a sense of opulence and power. The request is for a third-person view of the car.
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Step1>
      Create a photorealistic rendering of a Lamborghini Huracán sports car, viewed from a third-person perspective, capturing its aggressive lines and distinctive Italian design. Ensure the model is clearly identifiable as a Huracán.
    </Step1>
    <Step2>
      Design the roof of the Lamborghini with a rug-patterned print that draws inspiration from Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam." Replace the hands with a single foot wearing a Nike Huarache pressing down firmly on a gas pedal. The foot and shoe should be highly detailed and seamlessly integrated into the rug pattern. The rug design should complement the Baroque aesthetic.
    </Step3>
    <Step3>
      Incorporate Baroque-style elements throughout the image. This may include:
      *   Ornate details subtly integrated into the car's body (e.g., around the headlights or air intakes).
      *   Dramatic lighting with strong contrasts (chiaroscuro) to highlight the car's form.
      *   A background that suggests a Baroque palace or grand landscape.
    </Step3>
    <Step4>
      Maintain a consistent color palette that is both luxurious and evocative of the Baroque period (e.g., golds, deep reds, rich blues, and possibly some contrasting blacks).
    </Step4>
    <Step5>
      Ensure the Nike Huarache is accurately depicted and recognizable, but the branding should not overwhelm the overall artistic style. It should be a deliberate and stylish detail.
    </Step5>
    <Step6>
      Pay close attention to the lighting, reflections, and textures on the car's surface to enhance its realism and visual impact.  The rug pattern on the roof should appear tactile and believable.
    </Step6>
  </Instructions>

    </Constraint>
    <Constraint>

      Consider adding subtle Baroque-style patterns or textures to the car's paint or interior.
    </Suggestion>
    <Suggestion>
      Experiment with different angles and perspectives to find the most visually dynamic composition. A slightly lower angle might emphasize the car's power and the design of the roof.
