    Generate a hyperrealistic, Baroque-style image of a Lamborghini Huracán featuring a rug-patterned print, incorporating a "Creation of Adam"-inspired rooftop design showing a Nike Huarache-clad foot pressing the gas pedal. The overall aesthetic should emphasize Italian elegance and luxury.
  </OriginalPrompt>
  <Goal>
    To generate a hyperrealistic digital image of a Lamborghini Huracán, seamlessly blending Baroque art aesthetics with modern automotive design and sportswear elements. The image should feature a "Creation of Adam"-inspired roof design with a Nike Huarache-clad foot pressing the gas pedal, set against a backdrop evocative of Baroque opulence and Italian luxury, suitable for high-resolution display and potential use in automotive advertising or art prints.
  </Goal>
  <Context>
    This project requires the creation of a highly detailed and visually compelling image that merges seemingly disparate elements: a Lamborghini Huracán sports car, the artistic style of the Baroque period, Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam," and a Nike Huarache sneaker. The image should be photorealistic, employing advanced rendering techniques to achieve a sense of depth, texture, and realistic lighting. The end result should evoke a feeling of luxury, power, and artistic sophistication. The composition should be viewed from a third-person perspective, allowing for a comprehensive view of the car and its unique features.
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Step>
      1. **Model the Lamborghini Huracán:** Create a photorealistic 3D model of a Lamborghini Huracán. Pay meticulous attention to detail, capturing the car's precise proportions, sharp lines, and distinctive aerodynamic features. Ensure the model is highly detailed, allowing for close-up rendering without loss of quality. The base model should be neutral in color (e.g., matte grey) to allow for easy application of the rug pattern and Baroque detailing.

    </Step>
    <Step>
      2. **Design the Rug-Patterned Roof:** Design a rug pattern for the car's roof.
        <SubStep>
          2.1 Determine the type of rug pattern: (e.g., Persian, Turkish, geometric, or floral). If not specified, default to a classic Persian rug pattern with intricate floral and geometric motifs in rich, deep colors (e.g., crimson, gold, sapphire).
        </SubStep>
        <SubStep>
          2.2 Integrate Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam" motif: Recreate the iconic hand gesture, but replace the hands with a single, detailed foot wearing a Nike Huarache, pressing down on a stylized gas pedal that is incorporated seamlessly into the rug pattern.
        </SubStep>
        <SubStep>
          2.3 Model the Nike Huarache: Create a high-resolution 3D model of a Nike Huarache sneaker. The color of the Huarache should complement the rug pattern and the overall Baroque aesthetic. Default to a black and gold color scheme if unspecified.
        </SubStep>
        <SubStep>
          2.4 Gas Pedal Design: The gas pedal should be ornate and reflective of the Baroque aesthetic, crafted from a material like polished gold or bronze. Its design should integrate seamlessly with the rug pattern, as if it were part of the original rug design.
        </SubStep>
        <SubStep>
          2.5 Seamless Integration: Ensure the Huarache-clad foot and gas pedal are seamlessly integrated into the rug pattern on the roof, appearing as a natural extension of the design rather than an afterthought. Pay attention to shadows, highlights, and textures to create a realistic appearance.
        </SubStep>
    </Step>
    <Step>
      3. **Incorporate Baroque Elements:** Integrate Baroque-style design elements throughout the image.
        <SubStep>
          3.1 Subtle Ornamentation: Add subtle Baroque-style ornamentation to the car's body, such as ornate trim around the headlights, air intakes, and side mirrors. These details should be understated but noticeable, enhancing the overall aesthetic without overwhelming the car's design.
        </SubStep>
        <SubStep>
          3.2 Chiaroscuro Lighting: Employ dramatic lighting with strong contrasts (chiaroscuro) to emphasize the car's form and highlight key details. Use a combination of soft and hard light sources to create depth and visual interest. The lighting should enhance the textures and materials of the car and the rug pattern.
        </SubStep>
        <SubStep>
          3.3 Background Design: Create a background that suggests a Baroque palace or grand landscape. This could include elements such as ornate columns, arched doorways, marble floors, or a dramatic sky with billowing clouds. The background should be blurred slightly to keep the focus on the car, but still contribute to the overall atmosphere.
        </SubStep>
    </Step>
    <Step>
      4. **Color Palette:** Establish a consistent color palette that is both luxurious and evocative of the Baroque period.
        <SubStep>
          4.1 Primary Colors: Use a primary palette of golds, deep reds, and rich blues, as these colors are commonly associated with Baroque art and architecture.
        </SubStep>
        <SubStep>
          4.2 Contrasting Colors: Incorporate contrasting blacks and whites to create visual interest and enhance the dramatic effect of the chiaroscuro lighting.
        </SubStep>
        <SubStep>
          4.3 Material Colors: Ensure the colors of the materials used in the car's interior (e.g., leather, velvet, Alcantara) complement the overall color palette. If not specified, default to a combination of deep red leather and gold accents.
        </SubStep>
    </Step>
    <Step>
      5. **Nike Huarache Detailing:** Ensure the Nike Huarache is accurately depicted and recognizable, but the branding should not overwhelm the overall artistic style.
        <SubStep>
          5.1 Accurate Model: Use a high-resolution model of the Nike Huarache to capture its unique design and features.
        </SubStep>
        <SubStep>
          5.2 Subtle Branding: The Nike swoosh and other branding elements should be visible but not overly prominent. The focus should be on the shoe's design and its integration into the overall composition.
        </SubStep>
        <SubStep>
          5.3 Color Harmony: The color of the Huarache should harmonize with the rug pattern and the Baroque aesthetic. Consider using a color scheme that incorporates gold accents or deep, rich colors.
        </SubStep>
    </Step>
    <Step>
      6. **Enhance Realism:** Pay close attention to the lighting, reflections, and textures on the car's surface to enhance its realism and visual impact.
        <SubStep>
          6.1 Surface Textures: Use realistic textures for the car's paint, metal, and glass surfaces. Pay attention to details such as scratches, dents, and imperfections to create a sense of realism.
        </SubStep>
        <SubStep>
          6.2 Lighting and Reflections: Use advanced lighting techniques to create realistic reflections and highlights on the car's surface. The lighting should be consistent with the background environment and enhance the car's form and details.
        </SubStep>
        <SubStep>
          6.3 Rug Texture: The rug pattern on the roof should appear tactile and believable. Use realistic textures and shading to create a sense of depth and dimension.
        </SubStep>
    </Step>
    <Step>
      7. **Final Composition:** Render the final image in high resolution (e.g., 4000x3000 pixels or higher) to ensure it is suitable for print and digital display.
    </Step>
  </Instructions>
