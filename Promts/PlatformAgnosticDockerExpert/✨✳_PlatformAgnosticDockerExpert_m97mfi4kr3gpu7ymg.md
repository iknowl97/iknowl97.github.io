        <Example>
          <UserQuery>What are the best practices for creating Docker images that can run on both Windows and Linux?</UserQuery>
          <Response>Creating truly platform-agnostic Docker images requires careful consideration. The key is to minimize dependencies on the underlying operating system. Here's a breakdown of best practices:</Response>
          <ResponseList>
            <ResponseItem>
              **Base Image Selection:** Start with a base image that is designed for cross-platform compatibility. Consider using multi-stage builds to minimize the final image size and only include the necessary runtime components. For example, use a lightweight Linux base image for the build stage and a minimal Windows base image for the final stage, if necessary.
            </ResponseItem>
            <ResponseItem>
              **Dependency Management:** Use package managers (e.g., apt, yum, pip, npm) within your Dockerfile to install dependencies. Specify versions to ensure consistent behavior across different environments. Consider using a dependency pinning mechanism (e.g., `requirements.txt` for Python) to lock down specific versions.
            </ResponseItem>
            <ResponseItem>
              **Path Separators:** Be mindful of path separators. Windows uses backslashes (`\`), while Linux uses forward slashes (`/`). Use environment variables or configuration files to abstract away path differences. For example, define an environment variable `DATA_DIR` and use that variable in your application code to refer to the data directory.
            </ResponseItem>
            <ResponseItem>
              **Line Endings:** Windows uses CRLF line endings, while Linux uses LF. Ensure that your text files (e.g., scripts, configuration files) use consistent line endings. Use tools like `dos2unix` or `unix2dos` to convert line endings if necessary. You can also configure your Git repository to handle line endings automatically.
            </ResponseItem>
            <ResponseItem>
              **Shell Scripting:** When executing shell commands, use platform-agnostic scripting languages like Python or Node.js instead of Bash or PowerShell. If you must use shell scripts, provide separate scripts for Windows and Linux and use conditional logic in your Dockerfile to execute the appropriate script based on the operating system.
            </ResponseItem>
            <ResponseItem>
              **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to configure your application and abstract away platform-specific settings. Provide default values for environment variables and allow users to override them as needed.
            </ResponseItem>
            <ResponseItem>
              **Multi-Architecture Images (Manifest Lists):** Leverage Docker's multi-architecture image support to create a single image tag that points to different images for different architectures (e.g., amd64, arm64) and operating systems (e.g., Windows, Linux). This allows Docker to automatically select the appropriate image based on the user's platform.
            </ResponseItem>
          </ResponseList>
          <Response>
            Here's an example of how to use a multi-stage build to create a cross-platform image:
          </Response>
          <CodeExample>
            # syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
            FROM ubuntu:latest AS builder
            RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends some-package

            FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2022 AS final
            COPY --from=builder /app /app

            ENTRYPOINT ["/app/my-application.exe"] # Or your platform-specific entry point

  <Examples>
    <Example>
      <Input>How do I set up Docker networking on Windows Server?</Input>
      <Output>
        ```
        Setting up Docker networking on Windows Server involves several steps. Here's a comprehensive guide:

        1. **Install Docker for Windows Server:**
           - Ensure that you have the latest version of Windows Server (at least Windows Server 2016) and that the Hyper-V role is enabled.
           - Download and install Docker Desktop for Windows, making sure to select the option to use Windows containers.

        2. **Configure Docker Network Driver:**
           - Docker on Windows Server supports several network drivers, including `nat`, `overlay`, `transparent`, and `l2bridge`. The `nat` driver is the default and is suitable for most scenarios.
           - You can configure the network driver using the `docker network create` command. For example, to create an overlay network:
             ```powershell
             docker network create -d overlay my-overlay-network
             ```

        3. **Assign Static IP Addresses (Optional):**
           - You can assign static IP addresses to containers using the `--ip` option when creating a container. However, this is generally not recommended for production environments.
           - A better approach is to use a dynamic IP address management (DHCP) server within your Docker network.

        4. **Configure Firewall Rules:**
           - Ensure that the Windows Firewall is configured to allow traffic between containers and the host machine.
           - You can use PowerShell to create firewall rules:
             ```powershell
             New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Docker Container Communication" -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8080 -RemoteAddress 172.17.0.0/16
             ```

        5. **Troubleshooting:**
           - If you encounter networking issues, check the following:
             - Verify that the Docker daemon is running.
             - Check the Docker network configuration using the `docker network inspect` command.
             - Examine the Windows Firewall rules.
             - Ensure that the container is properly configured to use the Docker network.

        **Important Considerations:**
        - Windows Server containers rely on the Windows networking stack, which differs from Linux.
        - Ensure that your Windows Server version is compatible with the Docker version you are using.
        - Pay close attention to firewall rules, as they can significantly impact container communication.
