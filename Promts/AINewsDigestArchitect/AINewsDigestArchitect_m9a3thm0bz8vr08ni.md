  <Instructions>
    <ProjectSetup>
      1. **Project Initialization:** Create a new Next.js project using `create-next-app`.  Use TypeScript for all code. Initialize Git repository.
      2. **Directory Structure:** Organize the project with a clear separation of concerns (components, pages, API routes, utilities, data fetching modules, types).
      3. **Docker Configuration:**
        *   Create `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files in the root directory.
        *   The `Dockerfile` should efficiently build a production-ready Next.js application.
        *   The `docker-compose.yml` file should define services for the Next.js application, a database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB - choose one appropriate for the data volume), and optionally a Redis instance for caching. Include proper volumes and network setup.
        * Ensure the application will restart automatically on failure
      4.  **Environment Variables:** Implement `.env.example` and instructions on setting up the environment variables.
    </ProjectSetup>

    <BackendDevelopment>
      1. **Data Sources:** Identify reputable online sources for AI news (e.g., ArXiv, VentureBeat AI, The Batch by Andrew Ng, etc. - provide at least 5 example sources in a configuration file. Make this easily configurable.).
      2. **Web Scraping & Parsing:**
        *   Implement robust web scraping using libraries like `axios` and `cheerio` or `puppeteer`. Choose one.  Handle pagination, rate limiting, and website structure changes gracefully. The application must not crash when a website changes its structure.
        *   Implement error handling and logging to capture any issues during scraping.
        *   Create modular functions to scrape each data source independently.
      3. **Data Storage:**
        *   Design a database schema to store news articles (title, URL, source, publication date, content, summary, AI tags).
        *   Implement data models using Prisma or Mongoose (choose one based on the database selected).
        *   Create API endpoints using Next.js API routes to interact with the database (CRUD operations).
      4. **Content Summarization:**
        *   Integrate with a text summarization API (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere, or a self-hosted model if feasible given resource constraints). Use only TRUSTED, reputable services with strong uptime SLAs.
        *   Implement logic to summarize the scraped content.
        *   Handle potential API errors and rate limits gracefully.
        *   Consider chunking long articles before summarization.
      5. **AI Tagging:**
        *   Implement AI tagging to automatically categorize news articles (e.g., AI Agents, LLMs, Models, etc.). Use a reliable natural language processing library or API (e.g., Natural, NLTK, or cloud-based solutions).
        *   Consider using a pre-trained model for topic classification to improve accuracy.
      6. **Automation:**
        *   Use `node-cron` or similar scheduling library to schedule the scraping and processing pipeline (e.g., run every hour).
        *   Implement logging to track the progress and identify any errors.
        *   Implement retry mechanisms for failed tasks.
    </BackendDevelopment>

    <FrontendDevelopment>
      1. **UI Design:**
        *   Design a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly UI for the news digest website. Prioritize readability and accessibility. Use Tailwind CSS or Material UI for styling.
        *   Create a responsive layout that works well on all devices.
      2. **Component Development:**
        *   Develop reusable React components for displaying news articles (e.g., ArticleCard, ArticleList, etc.).
        *   Implement pagination for the article list.
        *   Implement search functionality to allow users to find specific articles.
        *   Implement filtering by AI tags.
      3. **Data Fetching:**
        *   Use `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` with revalidation to fetch data from the backend API.
        *   Implement client-side caching to improve performance.
      4. **Error Handling:**
        *   Implement error boundaries to catch and display errors gracefully.
        *   Implement loading states to indicate when data is being fetched.
      5. **User Experience:**
        *   Implement features to enhance user engagement (e.g., social sharing, comments using Disqus or similar, newsletter signup).
        *   Ensure the website is fast and responsive.
    </FrontendDevelopment>

    <Deployment>
      1. **Docker Deployment:**
        *   Configure the Dockerfile to optimize the image size.
        *   Use multi-stage builds to separate build and runtime dependencies.
        *   Configure the docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate the services.
      2. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
        *   Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar to automatically build, test, and deploy the application on code changes.
        *   Automate database migrations as part of the deployment process.
      3. **Monitoring & Logging:**
        *   Integrate with a monitoring service like Prometheus or Grafana to track application performance.
        *   Implement centralized logging using a service like ELK stack or Graylog.
      4.  **HTTPS:** Configure HTTPS for secure communication. Use Let's Encrypt or a similar service.
    </Deployment>

    <Testing>
      1. **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for individual components and functions.
      2. **Integration Tests:** Write integration tests to verify the interaction between different parts of the application.
      3. **End-to-End Tests:** Write end-to-end tests to simulate user interactions and verify the overall functionality.
      4. **Performance Testing:** Perform load testing to ensure the application can handle a reasonable amount of traffic.
    </Testing>
