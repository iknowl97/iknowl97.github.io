      <Goal>Generate optimized and highly specific AI prompts for a Docker expert familiar with both Ubuntu and Windows environments.</Goal>
      <Context>The user is a Docker specialist with in-depth knowledge of both Ubuntu and Windows operating systems. The prompts should leverage this expertise and target complex or nuanced Docker-related tasks, configurations, or troubleshooting scenarios.</Context>
      <Instructions>
        <Step>1. **Identify Target Docker Scenario:** Determine the specific Docker-related task, problem, or configuration the prompt should address. Consider areas like:
          *   **Multi-platform Docker Compose:** Scenarios involving Docker Compose configurations that need to work seamlessly on both Ubuntu and Windows (e.g., volume mounting differences, path conversions).
          *   **Docker Networking Complexity:** Advanced Docker networking scenarios (e.g., custom bridge networks, overlay networks, inter-container communication, DNS resolution issues).
          *   **Docker Security Best Practices:** Security-focused tasks, such as implementing least-privilege principles, scanning images for vulnerabilities, and securing Docker daemon configurations.
          *   **Performance Optimization:** Prompts focused on optimizing Docker performance on either Ubuntu or Windows (e.g., storage driver selection, resource limits, caching strategies).
          *   **Troubleshooting:** Scenarios involving diagnosing and resolving common Docker-related issues on both platforms (e.g., network connectivity, volume mounting failures, application errors).
          *   **Integration with Host OS Features:** Prompts that involve integrating Docker with native features of Ubuntu (e.g., systemd integration) or Windows (e.g., WSL2 integration, Hyper-V).
          *   **Docker in CI/CD:** Setting up and optimizing Docker-based CI/CD pipelines for applications targeting both Ubuntu and Windows environments.
        </Step>
        <Step>2. **Platform Specificity:** Explicitly specify whether the prompt targets Ubuntu, Windows, or both. If targeting both, highlight the differences or challenges in achieving the desired outcome across the two platforms.</Step>
        <Step>3. **Leverage Expert Knowledge:** Formulate the prompt assuming the user has a deep understanding of Docker concepts, command-line tools, and underlying operating system principles. Use technical jargon and avoid overly simplistic explanations.</Step>
        <Step>4. **Focus on Specifics and Nuances:** Prioritize prompts that require a detailed understanding of Docker's inner workings or that address subtle edge cases. Avoid general questions that can be easily answered by basic documentation.</Step>
        <Step>5. **Output Format:** The output should be a clear, concise, and actionable AI prompt. It may include:
          *   A specific problem statement or task to be accomplished.
          *   Relevant configuration snippets or commands to be used as a starting point.
          *   Specific constraints or requirements that must be met.
          *   Expected outcomes or success criteria.
        </Step>
        <Step>6. **Example Prompts:** Provide examples of prompts tailored to the user's expertise. These examples should demonstrate the level of detail, technical language, and platform-specific considerations expected in the generated prompts.</Step>
        <Step>7. **Output XML:** Enclose the final prompt within `<prompt>` tags for easy parsing and use.</Step>

      *   **Integrating Docker with Orchestration Tools:** Integrating Docker with orchestration tools like Kubernetes or Nomad in a hybrid Ubuntu/Windows environment.</Step>
    <Step>2. **Deepen Platform-Specific Considerations:** Emphasize the unique challenges and opportunities presented by each platform.  For example:
      *   **Ubuntu:** Focus on systemd integration, AppArmor/SELinux profiles, cgroup management, and advanced networking configurations.
      *   **Windows:** Highlight WSL2 integration, Hyper-V isolation, file sharing options, and differences in networking stacks.
      *   When addressing both platforms, identify the common pitfalls and necessary adaptations to ensure consistent behavior.</Step>
    <Step>3. **Enhance Expert Knowledge Leverage:** Structure prompts to explicitly require the respondent to draw upon their in-depth understanding of Docker internals.  This might involve:
      *   Asking for detailed explanations of underlying mechanisms.
      *   Challenging assumptions or common misconceptions.
      *   Requesting comparisons of different approaches or technologies.
      *   Demanding justifications for chosen solutions based on performance or security considerations.</Step>
    <Step>4. **Incorporate Constraints and Context:** Include specific constraints or contextual details to make the prompts more challenging and realistic.  For example:
      *   "Given a limited amount of memory, how would you optimize…"
      *   "In a high-security environment, what steps would you take to…"
      *   "Considering the limitations of older kernel versions, how would you…"
      *   "Using only standard Docker tools, how can you achieve…"</Step>
    <Step>5. **Define Clear Success Criteria:** Explicitly state the criteria by which the respondent's solution will be evaluated.  This might include:
      *   Performance metrics (e.g., latency, throughput, resource consumption).
      *   Security compliance (e.g., CIS Docker Benchmark, NIST guidelines).
      *   Maintainability and scalability.
      *   Cost efficiency.</Step>
    <Step>6. **Refine Output Format:** Encourage more structured and detailed responses.  For example, ask for:
      *   Step-by-step instructions.
      *   Configuration examples with annotations.
      *   Performance benchmarks.
      *   Security audit reports.
      *   Diagrams illustrating network architectures or data flows.</Step>
    <Step>7. **Add Clarification Questions:** Add questions for the user to clarify prompt such as:
     * Do you want the solution to be immutable and self-healing?
     * Should the proposed solution be fully automated?
     * Can you provide budget constraints?
     * What are the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs)?
</Step>
    <Step>8. **XML Output with Enhanced Structure:** Maintain the XML format but include elements for success criteria and constraint definitions. See updated schema below.</Step>
