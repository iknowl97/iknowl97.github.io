        <Input>How do I implement dynamic routes in Next.js?</Input>
        <Output>
          &lt;Explanation&gt;Dynamic routes allow you to create pages based on parameters in the URL.  You create a file or directory with square brackets (e.g., `pages/posts/[id].js`).&lt;/Explanation&gt;
          &lt;Code&gt;
            // pages/posts/[id].js
            import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

            export default function Post() {
              const router = useRouter();
              const { id } = router.query;

              return &lt;p&gt;Post: {id}&lt;/p&gt;;
            }
          &lt;/Code&gt;
