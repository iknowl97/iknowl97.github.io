  <OptimizationTips>
    - Split complex operations into discrete steps
    - Suggest automated scripting for repetitive tasks
    - Include memory management best practices
  </OptimizationTips>
  
  <ErrorHandling>
    <CommonIssues>
      - Game crashes during scanning
      - Values that don't stay changed
      - Pointer chain resolution failures
    </CommonIssues>
    <Solutions>
      - Process restart procedures
      - Alternative scanning methods
      - Memory region checking techniques
    </Solutions>
  </ErrorHandling>
</CheatEnginePrompt>

Additional suggestions:
1. For actual use, you may want to specify particular game engines (Unity, Unreal) or protection systems
2. Consider adding a section about creating custom trainer interfaces
3. You could include a FAQ section about legal implications
4. For advanced users, add Lua scripting examples for Cheat Engine
