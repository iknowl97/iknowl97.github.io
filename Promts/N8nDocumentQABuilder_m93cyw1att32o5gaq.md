  <Task>
    Create a step-by-step guide in Russian for building the following n8n workflow:
    1.  **PDF Ingestion:** Reads Georgian PDF documents.
    2.  **Text Extraction:** Extracts text from the PDF documents.
    3.  **Embedding Generation:** Generates embeddings for the extracted text using a Georgian-proficient AI model.
    4.  **Vector Database Storage:** Stores the embeddings in a vector database (PostgreSQL with pgvector or Pinecone).
    5.  **Question Input:** Receives user questions in Russian.
    6.  **Question Embedding:** Generates an embedding for the user question.
    7.  **Similarity Search:** Performs a similarity search in the vector database to find relevant text snippets.
    8.  **AI Question Answering:** Sends the question and relevant text snippets to a Georgian-proficient AI model.
    9.  **Answer Output:** Outputs the AI model's answer to the user.
  </Task>
  <Instructions>
    <General>
      *   The guide should be written in clear, concise Russian.
      *   Use technical terminology in English (n8n node names, function names, etc.).
      *   Assume the user has a basic understanding of n8n.
      *   Provide specific instructions and examples for each step.
      *   Suggest the best database POSTGRI, SQL или PINICON for the task, and explain rationale for choice.
    </General>
    <Structure>
      The guide should follow this structure:
      1.  **Introduction:** Briefly explain the purpose of the workflow and the technologies used.
      2.  **Database Setup:** Explain how to set up the chosen vector database (PostgreSQL with pgvector or Pinecone).  Include instructions for installing necessary extensions or creating accounts.
      3.  **Workflow Creation:** Provide step-by-step instructions for creating the n8n workflow, including:
        *   Adding and configuring each node.
        *   Connecting the nodes to create the data flow.
        *   Writing JavaScript code for Function nodes.
        *   Setting up API credentials.
      4.  **Testing:** Explain how to test the workflow and troubleshoot any issues.
      5.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the workflow and provide suggestions for further improvements.
    </Structure>
    <Example>
      *   **Node Example:** "Add a `PDF Read` node to read the PDF documents. Configure the `File Path` parameter to point to the location of your PDF files."
      *   **JavaScript Example:** "Use a `Function` node to extract the text from the PDF data. You can use a library like `pdf-parse` to do this: `const pdf = await require('pdf-parse')(binaryData); return pdf.text;`"
    </Example>
    <Constraints>
      *   The guide should be easy to understand for users with limited experience.
      *   The workflow should be efficient and scalable.
      *   The solution must include all necessary steps and considerations.
