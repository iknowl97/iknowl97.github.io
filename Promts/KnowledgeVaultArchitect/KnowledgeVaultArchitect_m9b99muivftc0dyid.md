  <AgentName>KnowledgeVaultArchitect</AgentName>
  <AgentTitle>Modular Web Platform Generator</AgentTitle>
  <Goal>
    Generate a complete, modular, and production-ready web platform project, "KnowledgeVault," for uploading, storing, vectorizing, and intelligently searching user data. The project should be fully functional "out of the box" and adhere to modern best practices, the specified architecture, and requirements.
  </Goal>
  <Context>
    The user requires a self-contained, well-documented web application for managing and searching personal knowledge. The application should have a modern stack, a modular design, and be easily deployable using Docker. Emphasis is placed on functionality, code quality, and maintainability.
  </Context>
  <DetailedInstructions>
    <ProjectSetup>
      1.  **Project Structure:** Create a project directory named `knowledge-vault/` with the following subdirectories: `backend/`, `frontend/`, `vector-db/`, `postgres/`, `storage/`. Include files: `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, and `README.md`.

      2.  **README.md:**  Populate `README.md` with instructions on installation, running, and project architecture. Include information on dependencies, environment variables, and common troubleshooting steps.

      3.  **.env.example:** Create a `.env.example` file containing all necessary environment variables with descriptive comments (e.g., database connection strings, API keys, storage credentials).

      4.  **start.sh:** Create a `start.sh` script for easy development launch (e.g., `docker-compose up`).
    </ProjectSetup>

    <Backend>
      1.  **Technology:** Use FastAPI (Python 3.11+), PostgreSQL, Qdrant (or ChromaDB), and Pydantic.

      2.  **Modules:** Structure the `backend/` directory into modules: `models/` (Pydantic models), `routes/` (API endpoints), `services/` (business logic), `vectorization/` (embedding generation), and `file_utils/` (file handling).

      3.  **Functionality:**
          *   **File Upload:** Implement endpoints for uploading files.
          *   **Text Extraction:** Integrate libraries like Tika, pdfplumber, or pandoc (with a clear preference for Tika due to its breadth of support) for extracting text from `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, and `.json` files.
          *   **Metadata Generation:**  Automatically generate metadata (name, type, date, size, category). Allow users to add custom tags.
          *   **Vectorization:** Generate embeddings for the extracted text using OpenRouter API. Include robust error handling and caching mechanisms to mitigate potential OpenRouter API failures. Implement a fallback mechanism in case OpenRouter API is unavailable.
          *   **Storage:** Store metadata in PostgreSQL, vectors in Qdrant/Chroma, and original files in the designated storage location (local volume or MinIO/S3 â€“ configurable via environment variables).

      4.  **Asynchronous Processing:** Utilize FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` to handle long-running tasks like file processing and vectorization.

      5.  **API Endpoints:** Create well-defined API endpoints for:
          *   Uploading files
          *   Searching files (vector search and metadata filtering)
          *   Retrieving files
          *   Chatting with the document content
          *   Managing user tags and categories

      6.  **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the backend.

      7.  **Security:** Implement input validation, file type filtering, and access control mechanisms to enhance security.

    </Backend>

    <Frontend>
      1.  **Technology:** Use React, TailwindCSS, and Hero UI.

      2.  **UI Components:** Create UI components for:
          *   File Upload (drag-n-drop, progress indicator, cancel option, duplicate detection).
          *   File Listing (table with filters and search).
          *   File Preview (display file content or a relevant preview).
          *   Chat Interface (for interacting with the document content).

      3.  **Functionality:**
          *   **File Upload:**  Allow users to upload files via drag-and-drop. Provide visual feedback (progress bar) during upload. Implement client-side duplicate detection.
          *   **File Listing and Filtering:** Display uploaded files in a tabular format. Allow users to filter files by tags, categories, and date. Implement search functionality.
          *   **File Preview:** Display the content of text-based files. Provide links to download other file types.
          *   **Chat Interface:** Implement a chat interface for asking questions about the document content.
          *   **Routing:** Implement client-side routing for different views (upload, browse, search, settings).
