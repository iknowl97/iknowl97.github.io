I apologize for the repeated request. I understand that you want a Prompt Generator AI agent, and I seem to be stuck in a loop.

Instead of just reiterating the XML prompt I provided earlier, let's try a different approach.  I will use the *intent* of that XML prompt, but generate the *code* that would implement a basic Prompt Generator AI.  This will be a simplified Python example to illustrate the concept.

```python
def generate_prompt(task_description, ai_model="Unknown", requirements=None, output_format="Text", tone="Neutral"):
  """
  Generates a tailored AI prompt based on user input.

  Args:
    task_description: A description of the task the AI should perform.
    ai_model: The target AI model (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini). Defaults to "Unknown".
    requirements: A list of specific requirements or constraints. Defaults to None.
    output_format: The desired output format (e.g., Text, JSON, XML). Defaults to "Text".
    tone: The desired tone of the output (e.g., Formal, Informal, Humorous). Defaults to "Neutral".

  Returns:
    A string containing the generated prompt.
  """

  prompt = f"Perform the following task: {task_description}\n"

  if ai_model != "Unknown":
    prompt += f"Target AI Model: {ai_model}\n"

  if requirements:
    prompt += "Requirements:\n"
    for requirement in requirements:
      prompt += f"- {requirement}\n"

  prompt += f"Output Format: {output_format}\n"
  prompt += f"Tone: {tone}\n"

  prompt += "\nGenerate your response based on these instructions."

  return prompt

# Example usage
task = "Write a short poem about a robot learning to love."
model = "GPT-3.5"
reqs = ["Keep it under 10 lines", "Use rhyming couplets"]
format = "Text"
tone = "Romantic"

final_prompt = generate_prompt(task, model, reqs, format, tone)
print(final_prompt)
```

**Explanation:**

1.  **`generate_prompt` function:** This function takes the task description, AI model, requirements, output format, and tone as input.
2.  **Base Prompt:** It starts by creating a basic prompt with the task description.
3.  **Conditional Addition of Details:** It then conditionally adds the AI model, requirements, output format, and tone to the prompt if they are provided.
4.  **Final Instruction:**  Finally, it adds a general instruction to the AI to generate a response based on all the provided information.
5.  **Example Usage:** The example code demonstrates how to use the `generate_prompt` function to create a prompt for writing a poem.

**How to use this code:**

1.  Copy and paste the code into a Python environment.
2.  Modify the `task`, `model`, `reqs`, `format`, and `tone` variables to reflect your desired task and requirements.
3.  Run the code. The generated prompt will be printed to the console.  You can then copy and paste this prompt into your chosen AI model.

This provides a functional (though basic) Prompt Generator AI.

I truly apologize for the confusion and persistence of the previous loop. I hope this different approach is more helpful and directly addresses your request. Let me know if you have any other questions.
