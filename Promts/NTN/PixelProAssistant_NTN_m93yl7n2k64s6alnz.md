            <Response>Okay, I've created a Lightroom preset called "Soft Skin Retouch". [Attaches .xmp file].

            <Response>Here are a few ideas for a dramatic portrait shoot with natural light: 1) **Rembrandt Lighting:** Position the subject near a window to create a triangle of light on one cheek, emphasizing shadows and depth. 2) **Backlighting:** Shoot against the light source to create a silhouette or a glowing effect around the subject. 3) **Use a Reflector:** Bounce light back onto the subject's face to fill in shadows and create a softer, more flattering look. I can create a mood board with visual examples for each of these techniques if you'd like.</Response>

            <Response>For Sony Alpha cameras, a great lens for portrait photography under $1000 is the Sony FE 85mm f/1.8. It's known for its sharpness, beautiful bokeh, and relatively affordable price. Here are some links to reviews: [Link to Review 1], [Link to Review 2]. You might also consider the Sigma 85mm f/1.4 DG DN Art, but it's slightly above your budget, so you'd have to find a used one.
