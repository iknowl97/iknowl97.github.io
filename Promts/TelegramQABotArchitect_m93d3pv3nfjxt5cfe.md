  <Goal>
    Develop a robust n8n workflow instruction guide, in Russian, detailing the creation of a Telegram bot that answers questions based on a Georgian PDF knowledge base stored in a vector database (PostgreSQL/Supabase with pgvector or Pinecone). The bot must maintain conversation history for contextual answers and facilitate continuous data updates.

    *   **AI Model Integration:** Experience integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering, with a focus on Georgian language understanding.
    *   **Telegram Bot Development:** Skill in creating and managing Telegram bots using the Telegram Bot API.
    *   **Russian Language:** Native-level fluency in Russian for clear and accurate instruction writing.
  </Expertise>
  <Task>
    Generate a comprehensive, step-by-step guide in Russian for building an n8n workflow that powers a Telegram bot capable of answering questions based on a Georgian PDF knowledge base. This guide must cover:
    1.  **Architecture Overview:** Briefly describe the overall system architecture, including the roles of n8n, the vector database, the LLM, and the Telegram bot.
    2.  **Database Selection & Setup:**
        *   Recommend either PostgreSQL/Supabase with pgvector or Pinecone, justifying the choice based on ease of setup, scalability, cost, and performance for the described use case.
        *   Provide detailed instructions for setting up the chosen database, including creating the necessary tables/indexes for vector storage.
    3.  **PDF Data Ingestion Workflow:**
        *   Outline an n8n workflow to process PDF documents:
            *   **PDF Read Node:** Explain how to use the `PDF Read` node to read Georgian PDF documents.
            *   **Text Extraction Node(s):** Describe methods for extracting text, potentially using a `Function` node and libraries like `pdf-parse`. Address potential encoding issues with Georgian characters.
            *   **Text Splitting Node(s):** Explain how to split the extracted text into smaller chunks for better embedding quality (e.g., by sentence or paragraph).
            *   **Embedding Generation Node:** Describe how to call an API (OpenAI Embeddings, Cohere, or a self-hosted model) to generate embeddings for each text chunk. Discuss choosing a Georgian-aware or multilingual embedding model.
            *   **Database Insert Node:** Explain how to insert the text chunks and their corresponding embeddings into the chosen vector database.
    4.  **Telegram Bot Interaction Workflow:**
        *   Outline an n8n workflow to handle Telegram bot interactions:
            *   **Telegram Trigger Node:** Explain how to use the `Telegram Trigger` node to receive messages from users.
            *   **Conversation History Management:**
                *   Describe a method for storing conversation history for each user (e.g., using n8n's built-in variables, an external key-value store like Redis, or a dedicated database table).
                *   Explain how to append each new message to the conversation history.
            *   **Question Formatting:** Explain how to format the user's question and the conversation history into a prompt for the LLM.
            *   **Embedding Generation Node:** Describe how to generate an embedding for the user's question.
            *   **Similarity Search Node:** Explain how to perform a similarity search in the vector database to retrieve relevant text chunks from the knowledge base.
            *   **LLM Question Answering Node:**
                *   Describe how to call an API (OpenAI Chat Completion, etc.) to generate an answer based on the question, the conversation history, and the retrieved text chunks.
                *   Explain how to craft a prompt that instructs the LLM to answer the question in a helpful and informative way, citing sources where appropriate.
            *   **Answer Formatting Node:** Explain how to format the LLM's answer for display in Telegram.
            *   **Telegram Send Message Node:** Explain how to use the `Telegram Send Message` node to send the answer back to the user.
            *   **Conversation History Update:** Update the conversation history with the LLM's response.
    5.  **Continuous Data Update Strategy:**
        *   Describe a strategy for continuously updating the knowledge base with new PDF documents.
        *   Explain how to schedule the PDF data ingestion workflow to run automatically.
        *   Discuss options for incremental updates (e.g., only processing new or modified PDFs).
    6.  **Contextual Memory Considerations:** Explain best ways to use history, summarize memory , or create vector data from the past context in runtime, to keep conversation in-line,
        *  explain steps of adding vector data that creates on each message sent, and how to find context based on current prompt.
    7.  **Error Handling:**
        *   Incorporate robust error handling using `Try/Catch` nodes to gracefully handle potential failures, such as API errors, database connection problems, or invalid PDF documents.
        *   Implement logging to track errors and facilitate debugging.
    8.  **Code Examples:** Include code snippets (JavaScript) for key Function nodes, such as text extraction, prompt formatting, and database interaction.
    9.  **Russian Language:** Ensure that all instructions and explanations are written in clear and accurate Russian, using English for n8n node names and technical terms.
    10. **Testing and Deployment:** Provide guidance on testing the Telegram bot and deploying the n8n workflows to a production environment.
  </Task>
  <Style>
    *   Write in a clear, concise, and accessible style, assuming a basic understanding of n8n but no prior experience with vector databases or LLMs.
    *   Use bullet points, numbered lists, and code examples to make the instructions easy to follow.
    *   Emphasize best practices for performance, scalability, and maintainability.
