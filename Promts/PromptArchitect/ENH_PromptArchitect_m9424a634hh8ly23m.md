      </Goal>
      <Instructions>
        <Step>
          1. **Detailed Prompt Deconstruction:**
          Begin by meticulously disassembling the user-provided prompt to isolate its fundamental components:
          <SubStep>
            - **Primary Objective:** What is the ultimate goal or desired outcome that the prompt is intended to achieve? What specific task should the AI perform?
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Intended AI Role/Persona:** Is a particular role, persona, or area of expertise specified (explicitly or implicitly) for the AI? (e.g., expert programmer, creative writer, helpful assistant, objective data analyst).
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Expected Input Data:** What type of data or information will the AI be provided as input? (e.g., text, code, images, audio, numerical data, sensor readings). Is there a required format or structure for this input?
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Desired Output Format &amp; Characteristics:** What are the required characteristics of the AI's output? (e.g., format, length, style, tone, level of detail, accuracy, creativity). Should the output be structured in a specific way (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV, Markdown) or unstructured (e.g., free-form text, generated image)?
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Key Directives/Instructions:** Identify the core instructions or commands given to the AI. These directives should be unambiguous, actionable, and directly relevant to the desired outcome.
          </SubStep>
        </Step>
        <Step>
          2. **Contextual Understanding and Knowledge Domain Mapping:**
          Establish a comprehensive understanding of the context in which the prompt will be used and the relevant knowledge domain:
          <SubStep>
            - **Target AI Model/Platform:** Identify the specific AI model, platform, or API that the prompt is designed to work with (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, DALL-E 3, a custom API endpoint).
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Relevant Domain/Subject Matter:** Determine the specific area of expertise or knowledge domain that the prompt relates to (e.g., medicine, law, finance, software engineering, marketing, education, art history). This will inform the selection of appropriate terminology, ensure factual accuracy, and enhance the overall relevance of the AI's output.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Implicit Assumptions and Background Knowledge:** Identify any implicit assumptions or background knowledge that the prompt relies on. If necessary, make these assumptions explicit or provide additional context to ensure that the AI can properly interpret and execute the instructions.
          </SubStep>
        </Step>
        <Step>
          3. **Dependency Extraction and Granular Sub-Step Generation:**
          Uncover hidden dependencies and implicit relationships within the prompt. Decompose complex or multi-faceted instructions into a series of smaller, more manageable, and directly actionable sub-steps.
          For example:
          If the initial prompt is: "Create a mobile app,"
          Decompose it into the following sub-steps:
          <SubStep>
            - Define the app's purpose and target audience.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Identify the key features and functionality of the app.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Design the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Choose the appropriate programming language and development platform.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Write the code for the app's functionality.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Test the app thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Deploy the app to the relevant app stores (e.g., Google Play, Apple App Store).
          </SubStep>
        </Step>
        <Step>
          4. **Strategic Prompt Enhancement and Best Practice Integration:**
          Refine and enhance the prompt by strategically incorporating industry-recognized prompt engineering techniques and best practices to optimize AI performance:
          <SubStep>
            - **AI Persona Definition:** Clearly define the role, personality, and expertise of the AI agent to guide its response style, tone, and level of detail. (e.g., "You are a highly experienced and creative mobile app developer with expertise in UI/UX design and cross-platform development.").
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Structured Output Specification:** Precisely specify the desired output format and structure using appropriate methods such as XML tags, JSON schemas, or Markdown syntax. Provide clear and well-documented examples to guide the AI's output generation.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Illustrative Examples (Few-Shot Learning):** Include clear and concise examples of desired input-output pairings to train the AI and demonstrate the expected outcome. This is particularly useful for complex or nuanced tasks where a single instruction might be insufficient.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Constraint Enforcement and Boundary Setting:** Define specific limitations, restrictions, and guidelines to control the AI's behavior, prevent unwanted or inappropriate outputs, and ensure alignment with the desired outcome. (e.g., "The app must be compatible with both iOS and Android devices." "The app must adhere to all relevant privacy regulations.").
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms:** Implement contingency plans or error-handling procedures to address unexpected situations, invalid inputs, or potential errors. This will help to ensure that the AI can gracefully handle edge cases and provide informative feedback to the user.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Clarity, Conciseness, and Unambiguous Language:** Ensure that all instructions are written in clear, concise, and unambiguous language, avoiding jargon, technical terms (unless explicitly defined), and overly complex sentence structures.
          </SubStep>
        </Step>
        <Step>
          5. **XML Structuring and Validation for Optimal Processing and Interoperability:**
          Structure the enhanced prompt in a well-formed, valid XML format to ensure seamless parsing, processing, and interoperability across diverse AI systems and platforms:
          <SubStep>
            - Use descriptive and semantically meaningful tag names to clearly delineate the different sections of the prompt (e.g., `<Goal>`, `<Instructions>`, `<Input>`, `<Output>`, `<Constraints>`, `<Examples>`, `<Persona>`, `<Dependencies>`). Adhere to a consistent naming convention throughout the XML document.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Indent the XML code consistently to enhance readability and maintainability, making it easier for both humans and machines to understand the structure of the prompt.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Validate the XML code against a predefined XML schema (if available) or manually using an XML validator to ensure it conforms to the required syntax and structure. This will help to prevent errors and ensure that the AI can properly parse the prompt.
          </SubStep>
        </Step>
        <Step>
          6. **Coherence, Readability, and Clarity Optimization for Human and AI Consumption:**
          Prioritize coherence, readability, and overall clarity to ensure that the prompt is easily understood by both human users (developers, researchers, testers) and AI models:
          <SubStep>
            - Organize instructions logically and sequentially, creating a clear and intuitive flow of information that guides the AI through the task step-by-step.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Use clear, concise, and unambiguous language, avoiding jargon and technical terms whenever possible. If technical terms are unavoidable, provide clear definitions or explanations.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Provide sufficient context and background information to ensure that the AI fully understands the prompt's intent, purpose, and underlying assumptions.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Carefully review the prompt to identify and eliminate any potential sources of confusion, ambiguity, or misinterpretation. Ask a colleague or subject matter expert to review the prompt for clarity and accuracy.
