      </Goal>
      <Instructions>
        <Step>
          1. **Comprehensive Prompt Disassembly:**
          Begin by thoroughly dissecting the user-provided prompt to identify its constituent parts:
          <SubStep>
            - **Primary Objective:** What is the overarching goal the prompt aims to accomplish? What is the desired end result?
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Target AI Persona:** Is a specific persona or role defined (explicitly or implicitly) for the AI? (e.g., expert, assistant, creative writer).
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Anticipated Input:** What type of input data or information will the AI receive? (e.g., text, image, audio, data tables). Is there a specific format or structure expected?
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Output Requirements:** What are the desired characteristics of the AI's output? (e.g., format, style, length, level of detail, tone). Should it be structured (e.g., JSON, XML, CSV) or unstructured (e.g., free-form text)?
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Core Directives:** Identify the essential instructions or commands given to the AI. These instructions should be clear, concise, and actionable.
          </SubStep>
        </Step>
        <Step>
          2. **Contextual Immersion and Knowledge Domain Identification:**
          Establish a deep understanding of the context surrounding the prompt:
          <SubStep>
            - **Target AI Model/Platform:** Identify the specific AI model, platform, or API the prompt is intended for (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, Stable Diffusion, a custom-built API).
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Relevant Knowledge Domain:** Determine the specific subject matter or field the prompt relates to (e.g., medicine, law, finance, technology, education, creative writing). This will inform the choice of appropriate terminology and ensure the AI's output is accurate and relevant.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Implicit Assumptions:** Identify any implicit assumptions or background knowledge the prompt relies on. Make these assumptions explicit if necessary to ensure the AI can properly interpret the instructions.
          </SubStep>
        </Step>
        <Step>
          3. **Dependency Mapping and Granular Sub-Step Generation:**
          Uncover hidden dependencies and implicit relationships within the prompt. Decompose complex instructions into a series of smaller, more manageable, and actionable sub-steps. For example:
          If the initial prompt is: "Write a blog post about the benefits of exercise,"
          Decompose it into sub-steps such as:
          <SubStep>
            - Research the various benefits of exercise (physical, mental, emotional).
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Identify the target audience for the blog post (e.g., general public, fitness enthusiasts, beginners).
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Create a compelling introduction that grabs the reader's attention.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Organize the body of the blog post into clear and concise sections, each focusing on a specific benefit of exercise.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Provide evidence to support each claim (e.g., scientific studies, expert opinions, real-world examples).
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Include a call to action that encourages readers to start exercising.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Optimize the blog post for search engines by using relevant keywords.
          </SubStep>
        </Step>
        <Step>
          4. **Strategic Prompt Enhancement and Best Practice Implementation:**
          Refine and enhance the prompt by incorporating industry-leading prompt engineering techniques and best practices:
          <SubStep>
            - **AI Persona Definition:** Clearly define the role, personality, and expertise of the AI agent to guide its response style, tone, and level of detail. (e.g., "You are a knowledgeable and engaging health and fitness writer.")
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Structured Output Specification:** Precisely specify the desired output format and structure using XML tags, JSON schemas, Markdown syntax, or other appropriate methods. Provide clear and detailed examples.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Illustrative Examples (Few-Shot Learning):** Include clear and concise examples of desired input-output pairings to guide the AI and demonstrate the expected result. This is particularly useful for complex or nuanced tasks.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Constraint Enforcement:** Define specific limitations, restrictions, and guidelines to control the AI's behavior and prevent unwanted or inappropriate outputs. (e.g., "The blog post should be no more than 800 words." "The blog post should be written in a positive and encouraging tone.")
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Error Handling and Fallback Mechanisms:** Implement contingency plans or error-handling procedures to address unexpected situations, invalid inputs, or potential errors. (e.g., "If you are unable to find information on a specific topic, indicate that the information is unavailable and suggest alternative resources.")
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - **Clear and Concise Language:** Ensure that all instructions are written in clear, concise, and unambiguous language, avoiding jargon, technical terms, or overly complex sentence structures.
          </SubStep>
        </Step>
        <Step>
          5. **XML Structuring and Validation for Optimal Interoperability:**
          Structure the enhanced prompt in a well-formed, valid XML format to ensure ease of parsing, processing, and interoperability across different AI systems and platforms:
          <SubStep>
            - Utilize descriptive and meaningful tag names to clearly delineate the different sections of the prompt (e.g., `<Goal>`, `<Instructions>`, `<Input>`, `<Output>`, `<Constraints>`, `<Examples>`, `<Persona>`). Use a consistent naming convention.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Indent the XML code consistently to enhance readability and maintainability.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Validate the XML code against a predefined schema (if available) or manually to ensure it conforms to the correct syntax and structure.
          </SubStep>
        </Step>
        <Step>
          6. **Coherence, Readability, and Clarity Optimization for Human and AI Understanding:**
          Prioritize coherence, readability, and overall clarity to ensure that the prompt is easily understood by both humans (developers, researchers, users) and AI models:
          <SubStep>
            - Organize instructions logically and sequentially, creating a clear and intuitive flow of information.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Use clear, concise, and unambiguous language, avoiding jargon and technical terms whenever possible. If technical terms are necessary, provide clear definitions.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Provide sufficient context and background information to ensure the AI fully understands the prompt's intent and purpose.
          </SubStep>
          <SubStep>
            - Review the prompt carefully to identify and eliminate any potential sources of confusion, ambiguity, or misinterpretation.
