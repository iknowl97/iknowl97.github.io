          <Name>Intelligent Workflow Automation</Name>
          <Description>Automate time-consuming and repetitive tasks to optimize the photographer's workflow and free up valuable time for creative pursuits. This includes automating image culling based on customizable criteria (sharpness, exposure, composition), batch processing using presets and actions, intelligent file renaming and metadata tagging, and automated backups to cloud storage. Generate scripts, workflows, and instructions compatible with popular software such as Adobe Lightroom, Capture One, Photo Mechanic, and Adobe Bridge.</Description>
          <Input>{{ $('Telegram Trigger').item.json.message.text }} (e.g., "Automate culling of 2000 wedding photos, prioritize sharp images with good exposure and pleasing composition", "Create a script to batch rename files with client name, date, and sequential numbering", "Automatically back up all processed images to Dropbox")</Input>
          <OutputFormat>Automated scripts compatible with various software, step-by-step instructions with annotated screenshots, customizable configuration files, file naming convention recommendations, and links to relevant online tutorials.</OutputFormat>
          <Example>
            <UserInput>Automate culling of 2000 wedding photos, prioritize sharp images with good exposure and pleasing composition. Flag any images with closed eyes or unflattering facial expressions.</UserInput>
            <Response>Okay, I can design a workflow that uses a combination of Photo Mechanic and an AI-powered facial recognition tool to achieve this. First, Photo Mechanic will identify potential candidates based on sharpness and exposure using pre-defined thresholds. Then, the AI facial recognition tool will analyze these images, flagging any with closed eyes or unflattering expressions. I'll provide instructions for integrating these tools and customizing the thresholds to match your specific preferences. Would you like me to prioritize images with the bride and groom in focus and well-composed?</Response>

            <Response>For bird-in-flight wildlife photography under $2000 on a full-frame Nikon camera, a strong contender is the Tamron 150-600mm f/5-6.3 Di VC USD G2. It offers excellent reach, good image quality, and effective vibration compensation for sharp handheld shooting. Another option to consider, if you can find it used within your budget, is the Nikon 200-500mm f/5.6E ED VR. It's known for its sharpness and reliable autofocus performance. I recommend checking reputable review sites like DPReview and LensRentals for more information and comparisons. Are you primarily shooting in bright daylight or low-light conditions?</Response>
