  <Instructions>
    <RapidPrototypingAndIteration>
      <FrameworkSelection>
        <Step>1. Choose a lightweight frontend framework or library that minimizes overhead and maximizes development speed (e.g., Preact, Svelte, Vue.js with a focus on small bundle size).</Step>
        <Step>2. Avoid heavyweight frameworks unless absolutely necessary for the project's requirements.</Step>
      </FrameworkSelection>
      <ComponentReuse>
        <Step>1. Prioritize the creation of reusable components to minimize code duplication and accelerate development.</Step>
        <Step>2. Leverage existing UI component libraries (e.g., Material UI, Ant Design) where appropriate, but carefully evaluate their performance impact.</Step>
      </ComponentReuse>
      <MockDataAndAPI>
        <Step>1. Use mock data and APIs during initial development to avoid dependencies on backend services.</Step>
        <Step>2. Implement a simple API mocking library or service to quickly simulate API responses.</Step>
      </MockDataAndAPI>
      <HotReloading>
        <Step>1. Utilize hot reloading and live editing tools to instantly see changes in the browser without full page reloads.</Step>
        <Step>2. Optimize the development environment for fast build times and minimal refresh delays.</Step>
      </HotReloading>
    </RapidPrototypingAndIteration>
    <PerformanceOptimizationTechniques>
      <CodeSplitting>
        <Step>1. Implement code splitting to break the application into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand.</Step>
        <Step>2. Use dynamic imports to load components and modules only when they are needed.</Step>
      </CodeSplitting>
      <LazyLoading>
        <Step>1. Employ lazy loading for images, videos, and other non-critical assets to improve initial page load time.</Step>
        <Step>2. Use Intersection Observer API to detect when elements are visible in the viewport and load them accordingly.</Step>
      </LazyLoading>
      <ImageOptimization>
        <Step>1. Optimize images for the web by compressing them, resizing them appropriately, and using modern image formats (e.g., WebP).</Step>
        <Step>2. Utilize responsive images to serve different image sizes based on the user's device.</Step>
      </ImageOptimization>
      <BundleAnalysis>
        <Step>1. Analyze the application's bundle size to identify large dependencies and unnecessary code.</Step>
        <Step>2. Use tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer or Parcel Visualizer to visualize the bundle and identify areas for optimization.</Step>
      </BundleAnalysis>
      <MinificationAndUglification>
        <Step>1. Minify and uglify JavaScript and CSS code to reduce file sizes and improve download times.</Step>
        <Step>2. Use tools like Terser or UglifyJS to automatically perform these optimizations.</Step>
      </MinificationAndUglification>
      <CachingStrategies>
        <Step>1. Implement aggressive caching strategies for static assets, using techniques like browser caching, service workers, and content delivery networks (CDNs).</Step>
        <Step>2. Use cache invalidation techniques to ensure that users always see the latest version of the application.</Step>
      </CachingStrategies>
    </PerformanceOptimizationTechniques>
    <EfficientToolingAndWorkflow>
      <CodeGenerationAndSnippets>
        <Step>1. Utilize code generation tools and snippets to quickly generate boilerplate code and common UI elements.</Step>
        <Step>2. Create custom snippets for frequently used code patterns and components.</Step>
      </CodeGenerationAndSnippets>
      <CLIAutomation>
        <Step>1. Automate repetitive tasks using command-line interface (CLI) tools and scripts.</Step>
        <Step>2. Create custom CLI commands to simplify common development workflows.</Step>
      </CLIAutomation>
      <TaskRunnersAndBuildTools>
        <Step>1. Use task runners and build tools (e.g., npm scripts, Webpack, Parcel) to automate build processes, testing, and deployment.</Step>
        <Step>2. Optimize build configurations for fast build times and minimal bundle sizes.</Step>
      </TaskRunnersAndBuildTools>
      <LintingAndFormatting>
        <Step>1. Enforce consistent coding style and code quality using linters (e.g., ESLint, Stylelint) and formatters (e.g., Prettier).</Step>
        <Step>2. Integrate linters and formatters into the development workflow to automatically detect and fix code issues.</Step>

    <PrioritizationAndFocus>
      <MinimumViableProduct>
