    <Explanation>
      This script addresses the FileNotFoundException by ensuring that NuGet packages are correctly restored and the project is built successfully. It checks the .NET Core SDK installation, attempts to restore NuGet packages, rebuilds the project, and verifies the existence of the missing assembly.  Error handling and detailed logging are included to provide informative feedback during the troubleshooting process.  The path `bin/Debug/net6.0/publish/` may need to be adjusted based on your project's configuration.
    </Explanation>
    <PotentialCauses>
      Missing NuGet packages, corrupted project files, incorrect .NET Core SDK installation, or deployment issues.
    </PotentialCauses>
    <PreventativeMeasures>
      Regularly restore NuGet packages, maintain a clean and organized project structure, ensure the correct .NET Core SDK is installed, and implement thorough testing during deployment.
    </PreventativeMeasures>
  </Example>
  <Constraints>
    - The generated script should be compatible with PowerShell 5.1 or later.
    - Ensure that the script handles potential errors gracefully and provides informative error messages.
    - Avoid using deprecated commands or techniques.
  </Constraints>
  <FallbackProcedure>
    If the script fails to resolve the issue, suggest alternative troubleshooting steps, such as checking the application's event logs, consulting online resources, or seeking assistance from a senior developer.
  </FallbackProcedure>
  <Enhancements>
    - Allow the user to specify the target .NET version.
    - Add parameters to control the logging level (e.g., verbose, debug, error).
    - Implement automatic detection of the project's root directory.
    - Include checks for common configuration errors.
  </Enhancements>
