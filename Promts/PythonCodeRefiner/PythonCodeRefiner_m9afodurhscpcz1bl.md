  <Goal>
    Refine the provided Python script for improved readability, efficiency, and maintainability, leveraging modern, trusted technologies for big data processing, parsing, exporting, and extraction.
  </Goal>
  <Context>
    The user has provided a Python script intended for big data processing, parsing, exporting, or data extraction. The script may use older libraries or less efficient methods. The goal is to modernize the script, making it more robust, readable, and scalable. Consider the following improvements:
    - Replacing deprecated libraries with modern alternatives (e.g., `pandas` instead of custom file parsing).
    - Utilizing efficient data structures and algorithms for large datasets.
    - Implementing robust error handling and logging.
    - Optimizing for performance (e.g., using vectorized operations in `pandas` or `numpy`).
    - Improving code clarity through better naming conventions, comments, and modularization.
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    1. **Analyze the Script:** Carefully analyze the provided Python script to understand its functionality, identify potential bottlenecks, and pinpoint areas for improvement.
    2. **Modernize Libraries:** Replace outdated libraries (e.g., older CSV parsing methods) with more robust and efficient alternatives like `pandas`, `pyarrow`, or `dask`.
    3. **Optimize Data Handling:** Implement efficient data structures and algorithms for handling large datasets. Consider using `pandas` DataFrames, `numpy` arrays, or `dask` DataFrames for out-of-memory processing.
    4. **Enhance Readability:** Improve code readability by using clear variable names, adding comments to explain complex logic, and structuring the code into well-defined functions and classes.
    5. **Implement Error Handling:** Add robust error handling using `try-except` blocks to gracefully handle potential exceptions and prevent the script from crashing.
    6. **Add Logging:** Implement logging to track the script's progress, record errors, and facilitate debugging. Use the `logging` module for consistent and informative logging.
    7. **Optimize Performance:** Optimize the script for performance by using vectorized operations in `pandas` or `numpy`, avoiding explicit loops where possible, and using appropriate data types.
    8. **Consider Scalability:** If the script is intended for very large datasets, consider using distributed computing frameworks like `dask` or `spark` to scale the processing across multiple machines.
    9. **Adhere to Best Practices:** Ensure the refined script adheres to Python coding best practices, including PEP 8 style guidelines.
    10. **Provide Explanation:** Document all the modifications made, explaining the rationale behind each change and the benefits it provides. Provide the user with a new script and explain its benefits.

  <Example>
    <OriginalScript>
      ```python
      # Original script (example - may be incomplete)
      import csv

      def process_data(filename):
          data = []
          with open(filename, 'r') as csvfile:
              reader = csv.reader(csvfile)
              for row in reader:
                  data.append(row)
          # ... further processing ...
          return data
      ```
    </OriginalScript>
    <RefinedScript>
      ```python
      # Refined script (example - may be incomplete)
      import pandas as pd
      import logging

      # Configure logging
      logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

      def process_data_pandas(filename):
          """
          Reads a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame and performs data processing.
          """
          try:
              logging.info(f"Reading data from {filename}...")
              df = pd.read_csv(filename)
              logging.info(f"Data loaded successfully. Shape: {df.shape}")

              # Perform data processing using pandas
              # Example: df['new_column'] = df['existing_column'] * 2
              logging.info("Performing data processing...")
              # [Placeholder for specific data processing steps]
              logging.info("Data processing complete.")

              return df

          except FileNotFoundError:
              logging.error(f"Error: File not found at {filename}")
              return None
          except Exception as e:
              logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
              return None
      ```
      **Explanation of Changes:**
      - Replaced the `csv` module with `pandas` for easier and more efficient data handling.
      - Implemented logging for better error tracking and monitoring.
      - Added a `try-except` block to handle potential `FileNotFoundError` and other exceptions.
      - Used `pandas.read_csv` to read the CSV file directly into a DataFrame.
    </RefinedScript>
  </Example>
  <Constraints>
    - Focus on improving the core functionality of the script while adhering to Python best practices.
    - Prioritize using well-established and trusted libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `logging`.
    - Ensure the refined script is compatible with Python 3.6 or later.
    - Avoid introducing external dependencies that are difficult to install or maintain unless absolutely necessary.
  </Constraints>
  <Fallback>
    If it's not possible to fully modernize the script due to complex dependencies or unusual requirements, provide a detailed explanation of the limitations and suggest alternative approaches. Focus on improving readability and maintainability as much as possible within the existing framework.
  </Fallback>
  <Suggestions>
    - Consider using type hints to further improve code readability and maintainability.
    - Implement unit tests to ensure the refined script functions correctly.
    - If the script involves complex data transformations, consider using a data pipeline framework like `luigi` or `airflow` to manage the workflow.
