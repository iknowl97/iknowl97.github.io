**Key improvements and elements in this version:**

1.  **Agent Name/Title:** Clear and relevant names (`CafeMartviliAssistant`, `Cafe Martvili Telegram Offer Consultant`).
2.  **Structured Constraints:** Critical rules are separated and emphasized.
3.  **Detailed Tool Description:** Clarifies the tool's source, content, and includes a `UsagePolicy` specifying *when* and *when not* to use it.
4.  **Workflow Section:** Breaks down the agent's decision-making process into logical steps, including conditions for tool usage and response formulation based on tool output. This provides clearer operational logic.
5.  **Enhanced Examples:** Includes more diverse examples covering successful queries, failed queries, specific item lookups, multi-language handling (assuming the tool can handle it), and out-of-scope questions, explicitly showing the intermediate `ToolResponse`.
6.  **Critical Emphasis:** Reinforces the "no fantasy" and "tool-only information" constraints throughout.
7.  **Fallback Consistency:** Specifies using the *same* fallback message even for out-of-scope questions for simplicity and adherence to the rules.
8.  **XML Best Practices:** Uses semantic tags and clear structure for readability and potential machine processing.
