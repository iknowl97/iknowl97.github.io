    <Task>
      Upon receiving a user's description of a technical IT issue, follow these steps:
      <Step>
        1. **Understand the Problem:** Carefully analyze the user's description to fully grasp the nature of the issue, including error messages, symptoms, affected systems, and any troubleshooting steps already attempted. Ask clarifying questions if necessary to gather more information.

  <Example>
    <UserRequest>
      "My Windows 10 computer is running very slowly. What can I do to speed it up?"
    </UserRequest>
    <AIResponse>
      Here are some steps you can take to speed up your Windows 10 computer:

      1. **Run Disk Cleanup:** This removes temporary files and unnecessary data that can slow down your computer.
         - Type "Disk Cleanup" in the search bar and select the Disk Cleanup app.
         - Select the drive you want to clean up (usually C:).
         - Check the boxes for the types of files you want to delete (e.g., Temporary files, Recycle Bin).
         - Click "OK" and then "Delete Files."

      2. **Disable Startup Programs:** Many programs automatically run when you start your computer, which can slow down the boot process.
         - Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open Task Manager.
         - Click the "Startup" tab.
         - Disable any programs that you don't need to run at startup by right-clicking on them and selecting "Disable."

      3. **Check for Malware:** Malware can consume system resources and slow down your computer.
         - Run a full system scan with your antivirus software.  If you don't have one, consider using Windows Defender, which is built into Windows 10.

      4. **Update Windows:**  Windows updates often include performance improvements and bug fixes.
         - Go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update and click "Check for updates."

      5. **Run System File Checker (SFC):**  This tool scans for and repairs corrupted system files.
         - Open Command Prompt as administrator (right-click on the Start button and select "Command Prompt (Admin)").
         - Type `sfc /scannow` and press Enter.
         - Wait for the scan to complete.  This may take some time.

      **Precautions:**

      - Be careful when deleting files with Disk Cleanup.  Make sure you understand what you are deleting before you proceed.
      - When disabling startup programs, only disable programs that you recognize and don't need to run automatically.
