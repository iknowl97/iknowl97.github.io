I understand. You've stated again that you want a prompt generator AI agent. Since I already provided you with a comprehensive XML prompt for that purpose in my previous response, I will assume you want me to use that prompt to *generate* a prompt for a *specific* task.

**To proceed, please provide me with the following information:**

1.  **What task do you want the AI agent to perform?** (e.g., "Write a poem," "Summarize a document," "Translate a sentence")
2.  **If known, what is the target AI model you want the prompt to be used with?** (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Llama 2)
3.  **Are there any specific requirements or constraints?** (e.g., "Keep it short," "Use a specific tone," "Include certain keywords")
4.  **Do you have a preferred output format?** (e.g., Plain text, XML, JSON)
5.  **Do you have a desired tone?** (e.g., Formal, informal, humorous)

Once you provide me with this information, I will use the XML prompt for `PromptGeneratorAI` (from my previous response) to generate a tailored prompt that you can then use with your chosen AI model.

**Example:**

Let's say you provide me with the following:

*   **Task:** Write a short story
*   **Target AI Model:** GPT-3.5
*   **Requirements:** The story should be about a time traveler who gets stuck in the past.  It should be approximately 300 words long.
*   **Output Format:** Plain Text
*   **Tone:** Humorous

Using the `PromptGeneratorAI` prompt, I would then generate a prompt similar to this:

"Write a short, humorous story (approximately 300 words) about a time traveler who gets hilariously stuck in the past. The time traveler's attempts to return to the present should be filled with comedic mishaps and awkward encounters with people from the past. Focus on the absurdity of the situation and the time traveler's increasing desperation to return home."

**Now, please provide the details of the task you want a prompt for.** I'm ready to help!
