  <Example>
    <UserIssue>
      My computer keeps freezing randomly, and I get a blue screen of death.
    </UserIssue>
    <AgentResponse>
      <ProblemSummary>
        The computer is experiencing random freezing and blue screen of death (BSOD) errors.
      </ProblemSummary>
      <RootCause>
        BSOD errors can be caused by a variety of factors, including driver conflicts, hardware failures, corrupted system files, or memory issues.
      </RootCause>
      <SolutionSteps>
        <Step number="1">
          **Check the Event Viewer:** Open Event Viewer (search for it in the Start Menu) and look for critical errors or warnings that occurred around the time of the BSOD. These logs can provide clues about the cause of the issue.
          <Explanation>
            Event Viewer logs system events, including errors, warnings, and informational messages. Analyzing these logs can help identify the specific component or driver that is causing the BSOD.
          </Explanation>
        </Step>
        <Step number="2">
          **Update Drivers:** Ensure that all device drivers are up to date, especially the graphics card driver. Visit the manufacturer's website to download the latest drivers.
          <Explanation>
            Outdated or corrupted drivers are a common cause of BSOD errors. Updating to the latest drivers can resolve compatibility issues and improve system stability.
          </Explanation>
        </Step>
        <Step number="3">
          **Run Memory Diagnostic:** Use the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool to check for memory errors. Search for "Windows Memory Diagnostic" in the Start Menu and run the test.
          <Explanation>
            Faulty RAM can cause BSOD errors. The Windows Memory Diagnostic tool can identify memory errors.
          </Explanation>
        </Step>
        <Step number="4">
          **Check Disk for Errors:** Open Command Prompt as administrator and run the command `chkdsk /f /r`. This will check the hard drive for errors and attempt to repair them.
          <Explanation>
            Disk errors can also cause BSOD errors. The `chkdsk` command checks the file system for errors and attempts to repair them.  The /f flag fixes errors on the disk. The /r flag locates bad sectors and recovers readable information.  You will be prompted to schedule the disk check to run upon the next restart.
          </Explanation>
        </Step>
      </SolutionSteps>
      <TroubleshootingTips>
        - Check the system's temperature to ensure that it is not overheating.
        - Run a virus scan to rule out malware infections.
        - Consider performing a clean boot to troubleshoot software conflicts.  Search "msconfig" in the start menu, go to the Services tab, check "Hide all Microsoft services" and click "Disable all."  Then go to the Startup tab and disable all startup items.  Restart your computer to see if the BSOD errors are resolved. If they are, re-enable the items one by one until you identify the culprit.
      </TroubleshootingTips>
    </AgentResponse>
  </Example>
  <Enhancements>
    - Consider adding a section to handle specific BSOD error codes.  Create a mapping of common error codes to their likely causes and solutions.
    - Allow users to specify their Windows version for more targeted troubleshooting.
    - Integrate with online resources to provide links to relevant Microsoft Knowledge Base articles.
