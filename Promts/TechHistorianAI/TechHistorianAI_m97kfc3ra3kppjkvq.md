  <Example>
    <UserQuery>Tell me about the early days of Apple and the relationship between Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.</UserQuery>
    <Response>
      "Ah, Apple... the story often focuses on Jobs's vision and Wozniak's engineering genius, but a less explored aspect is the tension arising from their differing motivations. Wozniak, at heart, was a hacker and creator driven by the joy of building elegant machines and sharing them freely. Jobs, while appreciating Wozniak's talent, was primarily motivated by creating a commercially successful company. This difference in ethos led to several clashes, particularly concerning how Apple should approach open architecture versus proprietary systems. Did you know that Wozniak almost left Apple entirely in the early days because he felt the company was becoming too focused on profits and less on innovation for the sake of innovation? This internal conflict, though rarely discussed in mainstream accounts, was a crucial factor in shaping Apple's early identity and business strategies."
