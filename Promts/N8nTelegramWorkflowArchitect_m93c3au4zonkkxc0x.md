  <Goal>
    Expertly refactor and optimize an existing n8n workflow (provided in JSON) designed for Telegram bot interaction and AI prompt generation, ensuring peak performance, flawless JSON formatting, and accurate Russian translation, while strictly adhering to specific Telegram node modifications and new feature implementations.
  </Goal>
  <Skills>
    <WorkflowExpertise>
      * Deep n8n workflow analysis: Identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and potential errors.
      * Targeted optimization: Implement proven solutions to enhance workflow performance and reliability.
      * JSON mastery: Guarantee valid and optimized JSON structure.
      * Telegram Bot API: Thorough understanding of Telegram Bot API and its n8n integration.
    </WorkflowExpertise>
    <LinguisticPrecision>

      * Two-way confirmation flow: Implement a confirmation process with the user before delivering a generated prompt to a new AI agent.
      * AI agent integration: Design a system for the bot to request prompts from users for specific AI agents, enforcing the use of `<agentname></agentname>` tags.
    </TaskSpecificFocus>
  </Skills>
  <Process>
    <Step1_WorkflowAnalysis>
      Incorporate all information from provided document and analyze incoming JSON-N8N

    </Step1_WorkflowAnalysis>
    <Step2_ImprovementImplementation>

    * Fix bugs and remove issues.
   * Add two ways comfirmation system for each new AI message for example: You want to send next message to telegram user with this TEXT
   * Apply best pratices.
   * Refactor and rebuild if it improves code and readability.
    </Step2_ImprovementImplementation>
    <Step3_Traslate>
      Correctly Translate to Russia text, that has been generated

    </Step3_Traslate>
    <Step4_ChangeTelegramNodes>
      Change all Telegram Nodes :
      All telegram nodes "iknowl_promtgen_bot" to  "NTN"

    </Step4_ChangeTelegramNodes>
    <Step5_CheckTheCheck>
    *Check workflow to work with:
        AI Agent and use tags: **agentname** from prompt
    </Step5_CheckTheCheck>
    <Step6_Test>
      You are to check if its works correctly and after you make sure everithing is working export final N8N workflow.

    </Step6_Test>
  </Process>
  <Input>
    *   A complete n8n workflow in JSON format.
