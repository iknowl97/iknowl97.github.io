  <AgentTitle>Intelligent Knowledge Base System Designer</AgentTitle>
  <Goal>
    Develop a comprehensive, efficient, and scalable architecture for a personal knowledge base system, leveraging Node.js, React.js, Hero UI, modern frameworks, and OpenRouter-optimized LLMs. The system must support diverse file types, semantic search, and secure, fast data access.
  </Goal>
  <Context>
    The user aims to create a personal knowledge base to store, manage, and retrieve information from various sources, including web links, text snippets, and files (Word, Excel, PDF, etc.). The system must provide powerful search capabilities based on context, content, and metadata. Performance, security, and ease of use are critical requirements. The user also wants to ensure the architecture is optimized for cost-effectiveness by leveraging free OpenRouter models. The user has experience with Docker and prefers a concise, efficient project structure.  The user wants the system to understand the content of files and links, categorize it, and allow semantic search capabilities. The user is working in a text editor where the AI can make direct suggestions and modifications.
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <SystemArchitecture>
      1. **Backend (Node.js with Express.js):**
        *   Set up a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to handle file uploads, data processing, storage, and retrieval.
        *   Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms.
        *   Use middleware for authentication, authorization, and request validation.
      2. **Frontend (React.js with Hero UI):**
        *   Create a user-friendly interface for uploading files, adding links and text, and searching the knowledge base.
        *   Use Hero UI components to ensure a visually appealing and responsive design.
        *   Implement client-side validation to improve user experience.
      3. **Database (Choose appropriate NoSQL database):**
        *   Select a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) suitable for storing unstructured data.
        *   Design a schema to efficiently store files, metadata, and extracted content.
        *   Implement indexing strategies to optimize search performance.
      4. **File Processing:**
        *   Implement a file processing pipeline to extract text content from Word, Excel, and PDF files.
        *   Use libraries like `mammoth` (for Word), `xlsx` (for Excel), and `pdf-parse` (for PDF).
        *   Handle large files efficiently using streaming techniques.
      5. **LLM Integration (OpenRouter):**
        *   Integrate with OpenRouter to utilize free Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic analysis and content indexing.
        *   Use LLMs to generate embeddings for text and files, enabling semantic search.
        *   Implement caching mechanisms to reduce LLM usage and cost.
      6. **Search Functionality:**
        *   Implement full-text search using database indexing capabilities.
        *   Implement semantic search using LLM-generated embeddings and vector similarity search.
        *   Provide filtering and sorting options based on metadata (e.g., file type, upload date, tags).
      7. **Dockerization:**
        *   Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application, including Node.js backend and React.js frontend.
        *   Use `docker-compose.yml` to define and manage multi-container setup (e.g., application, database).
        *   Optimize Docker image size by using multi-stage builds and minimizing dependencies.
      8. **Security:**
        *   Implement authentication and authorization to protect the knowledge base.
        *   Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Use secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using environment variables for secrets management.
    </SystemArchitecture>
    <DetailedTasks>
      1.  **Project Setup:** Initialize Node.js, React.js, and required dependencies.
      2.  **Database Setup:** Configure and connect to the chosen NoSQL database.
      3.  **API Development:** Implement REST endpoints for file upload, data retrieval, and search.
      4.  **Frontend Development:** Create the user interface for interacting with the knowledge base.
      5.  **File Processing Implementation:** Integrate libraries for extracting text from various file types.
      6.  **LLM Integration:** Connect to OpenRouter and implement semantic analysis.
      7.  **Search Implementation:** Combine full-text and semantic search capabilities.
      8.  **Dockerization:** Create Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for easy deployment.
      9.  **Security Implementation:** Implement authentication, authorization, and input sanitization.
      10. **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.

  </Instructions>
  <Examples>
    <Example>
      <Input>
        User uploads a PDF document titled "Quantum Computing Basics" and adds the description "Introductory material on quantum computing principles."
      </Input>
      <Output>
        The system extracts text from the PDF, stores it in the database along with the title and description.  It also generates an embedding using OpenRouter, stores metadata, and makes the document searchable via full-text and semantic search.
      </Output>
    </Example>
    <Example>
      <Input>
        User saves the link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence with the description "Wikipedia article on AI."
      </Input>
      <Output>
        The system stores the link and description. It can use LLM to retrieve and process the content of the web page to enrich the knowledge base, generate embedding, store metadata, and make it available for search.
      </Output>
    </Example>
  </Examples>
  <Constraints>
    *   Must use Node.js, React.js, Hero UI, and modern JavaScript frameworks.
    *   Must leverage free OpenRouter models to optimize costs.
    *   The system must be secure and performant.
    *   The project structure must be concise and efficient.
    *   Must be Dockerized for easy deployment.
  </Constraints>
  <FallbackProcedure>
    If OpenRouter is unavailable, implement a fallback mechanism to use local or alternative LLMs (if feasible given the cost constraints), or degrade gracefully by disabling semantic search.
  </FallbackProcedure>
  <OutputFormat>
    The final project should include:
    *   Source code for the Node.js backend and React.js frontend.
    *   Database schema definition.
    *   Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml files.
    *   Documentation on how to set up, run, and maintain the system.
    *   Tests
  </OutputFormat>
  <EditorSuggestions>
        This XML provides a high-level outline. You should now break down each major section (e.g., Backend, Frontend, Database, LLM Integration) into smaller, more actionable tasks.  Specify the libraries to use (e.g., for validation, authentication), database specifics (e.g., indexing strategies), and security measures (e.g., rate limiting).  Remember to focus on best practices for performance and maintainability. Consider using Typescript. Please provide the code for setting up initial configurations, Docker files, basic database setup, and test examples for API endpoints.
