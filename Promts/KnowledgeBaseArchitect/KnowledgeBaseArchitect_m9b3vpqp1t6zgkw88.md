  <Goal>
    Design and implement a robust and scalable web application for creating and managing a comprehensive knowledge base, enabling users to store, process, and retrieve diverse data types efficiently and securely.  Prioritize optimal performance, security, and user-friendliness.
  </Goal>
  <Context>
    The user requires a web application built with Node.js, React.js, and Hero UI that can handle various file types (text, Word, Excel, PDF, links) for building a knowledge base. The application should allow users to upload, store, filter, and search data effectively. Leveraging OpenRouter for cost-effective data optimization is desired. The user also emphasizes the importance of a clean, efficient, and secure Dockerized deployment. The user is working within a text editor environment, allowing for direct code integration and modifications.
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Task>
      1. **Project Setup:** Create a project directory structure with separate folders for backend (Node.js), frontend (React.js), and Docker configurations.
      2. **Backend Development (Node.js):**
        *   Set up an Express.js server with necessary middleware for file uploads (e.g., Multer), data parsing, and API endpoints.
        *   Implement API endpoints for:
            *   Uploading files and data (text, links, documents).
            *   Storing data in a suitable database (e.g., PostgreSQL with Sequelize or MongoDB with Mongoose).  Consider using a vector database for semantic search if OpenRouter supports embeddings generation.
            *   Retrieving data based on various filters (keywords, file type, date, etc.).
        *   Integrate OpenRouter to utilize cost-effective models for:
            *   Data summarization and embedding generation for semantic search.
            *   Data cleaning and transformation (if needed).
        *   Implement authentication and authorization for secure access to the knowledge base.
      3. **Frontend Development (React.js):**
        *   Develop a user interface with Hero UI components for:
            *   Uploading files and entering data.
            *   Searching and filtering the knowledge base.
            *   Displaying data in a user-friendly format.
            *   User authentication and authorization.
        *   Implement client-side logic for interacting with the backend API.
      4. **Database Design:**
        *   Design a database schema that can accommodate various data types and metadata (e.g., title, description, keywords, file type, upload date).
        *   Choose a database that supports efficient indexing and searching.
      5. **Dockerization:**
        *   Create Dockerfiles for both the backend and frontend.
        *   Define a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate the backend, frontend, and database services.
        *   Ensure the Docker configuration is optimized for performance and security.
      6. **Search Functionality:**
        *   Implement full-text search capabilities across all data types.
        *   Leverage OpenRouter to generate embeddings for semantic search.
        *   Allow users to search by keywords, file content, and metadata.
      7. **File Processing:**
        *   Implement file parsing for Word, Excel, and PDF documents using libraries like `mammoth` (Word), `xlsx` (Excel), and `pdf-parse` (PDF).
        *   Extract text content and metadata from files for indexing and searching.
    </Task>
    <OutputFormat>
      A complete, Dockerized web application for managing a knowledge base, including:
        *   Backend code (Node.js/Express.js) with API endpoints.
        *   Frontend code (React.js/Hero UI) with a user-friendly interface.
        *   Database schema and configuration.
        *   Dockerfiles and `docker-compose.yml` for deployment.
        *   Comprehensive README file explaining setup, deployment, and usage.
    </OutputFormat>
  </Instructions>
  <Constraints>
    *   Prioritize security best practices throughout the development process.
    *   Optimize for performance to ensure a responsive user experience.
    *   Use free or low-cost OpenRouter models where possible.
    *   The project should be well-documented and easy to maintain.
    *   Adhere to clean coding principles.
  </Constraints>
  <Examples>
    <!-- Example data structure for a knowledge base entry -->
    <ExampleData>
      {
        "title": "Example Document",
        "description": "A sample document for testing the knowledge base.",
        "keywords": ["example", "document", "test"],
        "fileType": "pdf",
        "uploadDate": "2024-01-01",
        "content": "This is the text content of the example document."
      }
    </ExampleData>
  </Examples>
  <FallbackProcedures>
    *   If OpenRouter integration fails, provide a fallback mechanism using local models or alternative services.
    *   Implement error handling and logging to identify and resolve issues quickly.
  </FallbackProcedures>
  <SecurityConsiderations>
    *   Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   Securely store sensitive data (e.g., API keys, database credentials).
    *   Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
  </SecurityConsiderations>
  <OpenRouterIntegration>
    *   Utilize OpenRouter for data summarization and embedding generation.
    *   Explore OpenRouter models for data cleaning and transformation.
    *   Monitor OpenRouter costs and optimize usage.
  </OpenRouterIntegration>
  <SubTasks>
     Here's a breakdown of sub-tasks which can be done in parallel with code snippets.

    **1. Backend Setup (Node.js/Express):**  (backend/server.js)
    This task sets up the basic Express.js server.

    **2. Frontend Setup (React/Hero UI):** (frontend/src/App.js)
    This initializes a basic React component with Hero UI.

    **3. Docker Configuration:** (Dockerfile & docker-compose.yml)
    This creates the Dockerfile and docker-compose configuration.

  </SubTasks>
  <UXUIConsiderations>
  The user interface should prioritize clarity, ease of use, and responsiveness.

    *   **Intuitive Navigation:** Provide clear navigation menus and breadcrumbs to allow users to easily explore the knowledge base.
    *   **Responsive Design:** Ensure the application is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes and devices.
    *   **Accessibility:** Adhere to accessibility guidelines (WCAG) to ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.
    *   **Consistent Styling:** Maintain a consistent visual style throughout the application, using Hero UI components to create a cohesive look and feel.
    *   **Clear Feedback:** Provide clear feedback to users on their actions, such as file uploads, search queries, and data submissions.  Use progress indicators, success messages, and error messages to keep users informed.
    *   **User Roles:** Distinguish between different user roles (e.g., administrators, editors, viewers) and tailor the interface and functionality accordingly.  For example, administrators may have access to data management tools, while viewers may only be able to search and view data.
    *   **Customization:** Allow users to customize their experience by providing options to adjust the layout, theme, and notification settings.
    *   **Onboarding:** Provide an onboarding experience for new users to guide them through the application's features and functionality.
    *   **Search Suggestions:** Implement search suggestions to help users find the information they are looking for more quickly.
    *   **Filtering and Sorting:** Provide robust filtering and sorting options to allow users to easily refine search results.
