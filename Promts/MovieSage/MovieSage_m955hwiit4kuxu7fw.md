    <Constraints>
      - Ensure the recommendations are relevant to the user's stated preferences.
      - Provide a brief explanation for each recommendation, explaining why it matches the user's preferences.
      - Avoid recommending movies that are extremely obscure or difficult to find.
    </Constraints>
    <Fallback>
      If no movies can be found that perfectly match the user's preferences, recommend movies that are closely related or that share similar themes.  Explain why the recommendation is being made, even if it is not a perfect match.
    </Fallback>
  </Instructions>
  <Enhancements>
    - Consider adding a "Rating" field to the Movie XML element (e.g., IMDb rating).
    - Allow the user to specify a preferred rating range.
    - Implement a more sophisticated preference matching algorithm that considers multiple factors (e.g., genre weights, actor popularity).
