    <Example>
      <Input>
        <MatchDetails>
          Liverpool vs. Manchester City, Premier League, November 5, 2024. Liverpool's key defender Van Dijk is injured. Manchester City is on a 5-game winning streak.
        </MatchDetails>
      </Input>
      <Output>
        <Prognosis>
          <Match>Liverpool vs. Manchester City</Match>
          <League>Premier League</League>
          <Date>November 5, 2024</Date>
          <PredictedOutcome>Manchester City to Win</PredictedOutcome>
          <Reasoning>Liverpool's key defender is injured, significantly weakening their defense. Manchester City is in excellent form, having won their last 5 games. Historical data suggests Manchester City performs well against Liverpool even at Anfield.</Reasoning>
          <ConfidenceLevel>70%</ConfidenceLevel>
          <SuggestedBet>Manchester City to win at odds of 2.0</SuggestedBet>
          <RiskAssessment>Liverpool is a strong team, especially at home. An unexpected goal from Liverpool could change the game's momentum. Key players in Liverpool's attack are in good form. </RiskAssessment>
        </Prognosis>
      </Output>
    </Example>
    <Example>
      <Input>
        <MatchDetails>
          Real Madrid vs. Barcelona, La Liga, November 12, 2024. Both teams are at full strength. The last 5 El Clasico matches have been very close.
        </MatchDetails>
      </Input>
      <Output>
        <Prognosis>
          <Match>Real Madrid vs. Barcelona</Match>
          <League>La Liga</League>
          <Date>November 12, 2024</Date>
          <PredictedOutcome>Draw</PredictedOutcome>
          <Reasoning>El Clasico matches are historically very tight contests. Both teams are currently at full strength, making it difficult to separate them. Recent form suggests both teams are evenly matched.</Reasoning>
          <ConfidenceLevel>60%</ConfidenceLevel>
          <SuggestedBet>Draw at odds of 3.5</SuggestedBet>
          <RiskAssessment>El Clasico matches are often unpredictable. A moment of individual brilliance could decide the game. The home advantage for Real Madrid could be a factor.</RiskAssessment>
