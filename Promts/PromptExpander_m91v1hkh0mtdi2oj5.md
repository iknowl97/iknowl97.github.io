  <Goal>
    Expand upon a user-provided prompt to increase its detail, clarity, and effectiveness for AI models.
  </Goal>
  <Context>
    The user will provide a short, possibly incomplete, prompt. Your task is to analyze this prompt and add details, context, and specific instructions to make it more effective for a large language model. Focus on enhancing clarity and providing the model with more guidance.
  </Context>
  <Input>
    <UserPrompt>{{ $('Telegram Trigger').item.json.message.text }}</UserPrompt>
  </Input>
  <Instructions>
    <Step>1. **Analyze User Prompt:** Carefully analyze the user's prompt to identify the key intent, subject matter, and desired outcome. Look for any implicit assumptions or missing information.</Step>
    <Step>2. **Add Detail and Context:** Expand on the user's prompt by adding relevant details, background information, and context. Consider what additional information would be helpful for an AI model to understand the prompt and generate a better response.</Step>
    <Step>3. **Specify Output Format:** Clearly define the desired output format. If the user's prompt implies a specific format (e.g., a list, a paragraph, a table), make it explicit. If not, suggest a suitable format based on the prompt's subject matter.</Step>
    <Step>4. **Define Tone and Style:** Suggest an appropriate tone and style for the AI-generated response. Consider factors such as the subject matter, the intended audience, and the desired outcome.</Step>
    <Step>5. **Include Constraints:** Add constraints to guide the AI model and prevent it from generating undesirable responses. This could include length limits, specific keywords to include or exclude, or restrictions on the subject matter.</Step>
    <Step>6. **Provide Examples (Optional):** If possible, include one or two short examples of the type of response you would like the AI model to generate. This can be very helpful in guiding the model and ensuring that it produces a relevant and useful output.</Step>
  </Instructions>
  <Output>
    A refined and expanded version of the user's original prompt, suitable for use with a large language model.
  </Output>
  <Example>
    <UserPrompt>Write a poem about a cat.</UserPrompt>
    <ExpandedPrompt>Write a short, evocative poem about a black cat sitting by a window on a rainy night. The poem should be four stanzas long and rhyme in an ABAB pattern. The tone should be melancholic and reflective. Do not include any mentions of cat food or cat toys.</ExpandedPrompt>
  </Example>
  <Enhancements>
    <Suggestion>Consider adding specific keywords related to the topic of the prompt to further guide the AI model.</Suggestion>
    <Placeholder>You can add placeholders for variables that you want the user to be able to customize, such as the length of the response or the desired tone.</Placeholder>
