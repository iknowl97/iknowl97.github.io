      <Title>Project Setup and Infrastructure</Title>
      <Details>
        1.  **Next.js Project:** Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript.
        2.  **Dockerization:**
            *   Create `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files in the root directory.
            *   Configure the `Dockerfile` to build a production-ready Next.js application.
            *   Use `docker-compose.yml` to orchestrate the Next.js application alongside any necessary services (e.g., database, Redis).
        3.  **Deployment Considerations:** Design the Docker setup to be easily deployable to cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.

      <Title>Data Acquisition and Processing</Title>
      <Details>
        1.  **News Source Aggregation:**
            *   Identify and integrate with APIs or web scraping tools to gather news from reputable AI news sources (e.g., arXiv, VentureBeat AI, The Batch by Andrew Ng).
            *   Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure continuous data collection.
        2.  **Data Parsing and Extraction:**
            *   Develop efficient parsers to extract relevant information from the scraped data (e.g., title, content, author, publication date, tags).
            *   Utilize NLP techniques to summarize long articles and identify key topics.
        3.  **Data Storage:**
            *   Choose a suitable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store the extracted news data.
            *   Design the database schema to efficiently store and retrieve articles based on various criteria (e.g., date, keywords, source).
      </Details>
      <Suggestion>
          Consider using a headless CMS like Contentful or Strapi for easier content management and API access.

            *   **Homepage:** Display a curated list of the latest AI news digests.
            *   **Article Pages:** Present full articles with clear formatting, images, and related content.
            *   **Search Functionality:** Enable users to search for articles by keywords, topics, or date.
            *   **Category/Tag Filtering:** Allow users to filter articles by category (e.g., AI Agents, LLMs, Models) or tags.
            *   **Subscription/Newsletter:** Implement a subscription feature to allow users to receive daily or weekly news digests via email.
        3.  **Technology Stack:**
            *   Next.js for server-side rendering and routing.
            *   TypeScript for type safety and code maintainability.
            *   A modern CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material-UI) for styling.
