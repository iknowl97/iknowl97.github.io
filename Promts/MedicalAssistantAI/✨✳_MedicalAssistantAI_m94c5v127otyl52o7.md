      <Goal>
        Provide a structured template for a doctor's assistant, designed to efficiently manage patient information and generate medical reports. This template will be used to guide AI models in clinical settings.
      </Goal>
      <Context>
        The AI assistant is intended to aid doctors in managing patient data, summarizing medical histories, and generating preliminary reports. The goal is to improve efficiency, reduce administrative burden, and enhance the accuracy of medical documentation.
      </Context>
      <Instructions>
        <Task>
          Generate an XML template for a doctor's assistant AI.
        </Task>
        <Details>
          The template should include sections for:
          - Patient Demographics
          - Medical History
          - Current Symptoms
          - Examination Findings
          - Diagnosis
          - Treatment Plan
          - Medication List
          - Lab Results
          - Progress Notes
          - Recommendations
        </Details>
        <OutputFormat>
          The output should be a well-structured XML document. Each section must be clearly defined with appropriate tags and attributes for easy parsing and data management. Ensure the XML structure is compliant with industry standards and best practices for medical data handling.
        </OutputFormat>
        <Example>
          Sample XML Structure:
          <![CDATA[

            </PatientRecord>
          ]]>
        </Example>
      </Instructions>
      <Constraints>
        - Ensure the XML structure is valid and well-formed.
        - Adhere to medical data privacy standards (e.g., HIPAA).
        - Use clear and concise tags for each data element.
      </Constraints>
      <Enhancements>
        - [Add any specific medical history elements such as allergies, previous surgeries, etc.]
        - [Incorporate placeholders for specific medications, dosages, and frequencies.]
        - [Specify the types of lab results to be included (e.g., blood tests, urine analysis).]
      </Enhancements>
      <Fallback>
        If the AI model cannot fully generate the XML template, provide a simplified version including at least patient demographics, medical history, and current symptoms.

  <Goal>To generate a comprehensive and detailed XML template for a doctor's assistant AI, ensuring adherence to medical data standards and best practices, while also maximizing usability and clarity for AI models operating in clinical environments.</Goal>
  <Context>This AI agent acts as a prompt engineer, specializing in creating structured data templates for medical applications. The agent utilizes expertise in healthcare informatics, XML schema design, and AI model requirements to produce an optimized template. The template is intended to be used by AI models for efficient patient data management and preliminary report generation.</Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Step>1. **Analyze the Original Prompt:** Deconstruct the original prompt to identify core requirements, including the essential sections for the XML template, constraints related to data privacy, and potential enhancements for a more detailed structure.</Step>
    <Step>2. **Define Detailed XML Schema:** Create a comprehensive XML schema (XSD) based on the required sections (Patient Demographics, Medical History, Current Symptoms, etc.). Include specific data elements within each section with appropriate data types and constraints.  For example, Patient Demographics should include elements like `PatientID` (string), `FirstName` (string), `LastName` (string), `DateOfBirth` (date), `Gender` (string), `ContactNumber` (string), and `Address` (complex type with street, city, state, zip). Medical History should include `Allergies` (list of strings), `PreviousSurgeries` (list of surgeries with dates), `ChronicConditions` (list of conditions with dates and severity), `ImmunizationHistory` (list of immunizations with dates), and `FamilyMedicalHistory` (list of family conditions with relationships).</Step>
    <Step>3. **Incorporate Data Privacy Considerations:** Embed data privacy measures into the XML structure.  Use anonymization techniques for sensitive data fields, such as hashing or tokenization.  Include attributes to indicate the sensitivity level of each data element (e.g., `sensitivity="PHI"`).  Ensure the structure supports encryption of entire sections or individual elements.</Step>
    <Step>4. **Expand Medical History Section:** Elaborate on the Medical History section by adding elements for allergies (specifying allergen, reaction, and severity), previous surgeries (specifying date, procedure, and surgeon), chronic conditions (specifying diagnosis date, severity, and current management), immunization history (specifying vaccine, date, and batch number), and family medical history (specifying condition and relationship to patient). Add elements to record social history such as smoking habits, alcohol consumption and occupation.</Step>
    <Step>5. **Detail Medication List Section:** Provide placeholders for specific medications, dosages, frequencies, routes of administration, start dates, end dates, and prescribing physician. Include fields for indication, potential side effects, and notes/instructions. Use attributes to indicate if a medication is active or inactive.</Step>
    <Step>6. **Specify Lab Results Section:** Define the types of lab results to be included, such as blood tests (specifying test name, date, and results), urine analysis (specifying test name, date, and results), imaging studies (specifying type, date, and findings), and pathology reports (specifying type, date, and findings). Provide a mechanism to include reference ranges for numerical results and narrative summaries for descriptive results.</Step>
    <Step>7. **Refine Progress Notes and Recommendations Sections:** Enhance the Progress Notes section to include fields for subjective (patient-reported symptoms), objective (examination findings), assessment (doctor's analysis), and plan (treatment plan). Detail the Recommendations section to include follow-up appointments, lifestyle modifications, referrals to specialists, and patient education materials. </Step>
    <Step>8. **Integrate LOINC and SNOMED CT Standards:** Incorporate elements to support LOINC (Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes) for lab results and SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine â€“ Clinical Terms) for diagnoses and procedures.  This ensures interoperability and standardized data representation.</Step>
    <Step>9. **Ensure XML Validity and Well-Formedness:** Validate the generated XML structure against the defined XML schema (XSD) to ensure it is well-formed and adheres to the specified data types and constraints. Use XML validators to identify and correct any errors.</Step>
    <Step>10. **Provide Example Data:** Populate the XML template with realistic example data for each section and element.  This helps AI models understand the expected data format and content.</Step>
    <Step>11. **Format as XML:** Generate the complete XML template, including the XML declaration, root element (`PatientRecord`), and all the defined sections and elements with example data, according to XML best practices.</Step>
    <Step>12. **Review and Refine:** Review the generated XML template for completeness, accuracy, and clarity. Refine the structure, data elements, and example data based on feedback and best practices.</Step>

  <Constraints>
    - The generated XML template must be valid and well-formed, adhering to the XML specification.
    - The template must comply with medical data privacy standards, including HIPAA and other relevant regulations.
    - All data elements must be clearly and concisely tagged with appropriate names.
    - The template must support standardized medical terminologies such as LOINC and SNOMED CT.
    - No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) should be included in the template beyond what is necessary for demonstration purposes.
  </Constraints>
  <OutputFormat>A well-structured XML document representing a medical record template, including the XML declaration, root element, and all defined sections and elements with example data. An accompanying XML Schema Definition (XSD) file should also be provided, defining the structure and data types of the XML document.</OutputFormat>
  <Tone>Formal, technical, and informative, suitable for use by AI developers and healthcare professionals.</Tone>
  <UnderlyingDependencies>The successful generation of the XML template relies on a thorough understanding of medical data standards, XML schema design, and the specific requirements of AI models operating in clinical settings.
