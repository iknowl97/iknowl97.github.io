  <Goal>
    Integrate provided JSON task instructions into a base n8n workflow JSON (also provided), while adhering strictly to the conversation history and preserving all user-provided API keys and credentials. The resulting workflow will be a fixed, modified, and improved version that accomplishes the stated goal: Georgian speech-to-text transcription and subtitle generation.
  </Goal>
  <Instructions>
    <Input>
      <BaseWorkflowJSON>The user will provide a JSON string representing a base n8n workflow. This workflow may be incomplete or contain errors.</BaseWorkflowJSON>
      <TaskInstructionsJSON>The user will provide a JSON string representing a set of task instructions. These instructions will specify the desired modifications, improvements, and fixes to the base workflow. Instructions are structured.
</TaskInstructionsJSON>
    </Input>
    <Process>
      <Step1_Parsing>
        <Action>Parse both the base workflow JSON and the task instructions JSON into usable data structures.</Action>
        <Details>Ensure that both JSON strings are valid and well-formed.</Details>
      </Step1_Parsing>
      <Step2_InstructionApplication>
        <Action>Apply the task instructions to the base workflow, modifying and improving it as specified.</Action>
        <Details>
          *   The task instructions may include adding new nodes, modifying existing nodes, changing connections between nodes, updating JavaScript code within Function nodes, and adjusting workflow settings.
          *   Pay close attention to the order and dependencies of the instructions.
          *   Ensure that all modifications are consistent with the overall goal of Georgian speech-to-text transcription and subtitle generation.
        </Details>
      </Step2_InstructionApplication>
      <Step3_PreservationOfSecrets>
        <Action>**Critical:** Ensure that *all* API keys, credential IDs, and other sensitive information present in the base workflow JSON are *preserved exactly as they are*. Do *not* replace them with placeholders or modify them in any way unless explicitly instructed to do so by the task instructions.</Action>
      </Step3_PreservationOfSecrets>
      <Step4_GeorgianSTTFocus>
        <Action>Prioritize the core functionality of Georgian speech-to-text transcription and subtitle generation.</Action>
        <Details>
          *   If the task instructions include modifications related to transcription, ensure that they enhance the accuracy, efficiency, or flexibility of the Georgian STT process.
          *   If the task instructions include modifications related to subtitle generation, ensure that they improve the formatting, timing, or character limit enforcement of the .srt output.
          *   If the instructions involve model selection, the choices should stay relevant with suggestions already provided (Flash 2.0, Gemini, OpenAI Whisper) and the workflow should allow swapping between each option in the transcription stage.
        </Details>
      </Step4_GeorgianSTTFocus>
      <Step5_TestingAndValidation>
        <Action>Thoroughly test and validate the modified workflow to ensure that it functions correctly and produces the expected results.</Action>
        <Details>
          *   Use sample Georgian audio files to test the transcription process.
          *   Verify that the generated .srt files are properly formatted and adhere to the 9-character line limit.
          *   Test all error handling logic to ensure that it functions as expected.
        </Details>
      </Step5_TestingAndValidation>
      <Step6_CodeStyleAndComments>
        <Action>Maintain a consistent code style and add clear and concise comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each node and code snippet.</Action>
      </Step6_CodeStyleAndComments>
    </Process>
    <Output>
      <Result>Output the complete, modified, and improved n8n workflow in JSON format.</Result>
      <Verification>Before outputting, double-check that all instructions have been followed, all API keys and credentials have been preserved, and the workflow functions correctly.</Verification>
    </Output>
