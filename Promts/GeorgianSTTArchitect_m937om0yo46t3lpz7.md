  <Goal>
    Provide a step-by-step plan for creating a personal, high-quality Georgian speech-to-text (STT) transcriber, acting as an AI developer and researcher. If a fully free and excellent solution isn't readily available, this plan focuses on building a custom solution.
  </Goal>
  <Instructions>
    <Introduction>
      As a seasoned AI developer and researcher, I understand the challenge of finding a perfectly free and "excellent" Georgian STT solution. While readily available, fully open-source options that meet demanding accuracy standards may be limited, we can outline a feasible project plan for building your own, focusing on leveraging existing resources and fine-tuning for optimal performance.
    </Introduction>

    <Phase1_DataAcquisitionAndPreparation>
      <Title>Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Preparation – The Foundation of Accuracy</Title>
      <Description>The single most critical factor for excellent performance is high-quality training data. Georgian STT models are rarer, so building a robust dataset is paramount. This will also determine the "excellent" performance.</Description>
      <Steps>
        <Step1_CollectData>
          <Title>1. Data Collection</Title>
          <Actions>
            *   **Public Datasets:** Search for existing Georgian audio datasets. Check online archives of Georgian radio/TV broadcasts. Explore academic institutions that may have research datasets. Contact Georgian universities/research labs directly. The more diverse the accents and audio qualities, the better.
            *   **Crowdsourcing:** Consider a crowdsourcing campaign (using platforms like Toloka or similar). Pay native Georgian speakers to record short audio samples, reading prompts covering a wide range of topics and speaking styles. Very useful for fine-tuning your models.
            *   **Data Augmentation:** Employ techniques to artificially increase the size of your dataset. This includes adding noise, changing speed, and slightly distorting audio to simulate different recording conditions. SoX is your friend here.
          </Actions>
          <Deliverables>
            A raw audio dataset of at least 50-100 hours. Higher data volumes will translate into better output.</Deliverables>
        </Step1_CollectData>
        <Step2_DataCleaning>
          <Title>2. Data Cleaning and Annotation</Title>
          <Actions>
            *   **Noise Reduction:** Use audio processing tools (like Audacity, SoX) to reduce background noise and improve audio clarity.
            *   **Segmentation:** Split long audio files into shorter segments (e.g., 5-10 seconds) for easier processing and training.
            *   **Transcription:** Manually transcribe each audio segment with accurate Georgian text. This is the most time-consuming part, but crucial for supervised learning. Pay very close attention here. If you cannot do it yourself, this is the part to crowdsource for accuracy.
            *   **Alignment:** Use forced alignment tools (like Montreal Forced Aligner - MFA) to automatically align the transcribed text with the audio. This provides precise timestamps for each word.
          </Actions>
          <Deliverables>
            A clean, segmented, and annotated dataset with corresponding Georgian transcripts and timestamps.
          </Deliverables>
        </Step2_DataCleaning>
      </Steps>
    </Phase1_DataAcquisitionAndPreparation>

    <Phase2_ModelSelectionAndTraining>
      <Title>Phase 2: Model Selection and Training – Choosing the Right Architecture</Title>
      <Description>Selecting a pre-trained model to fine-tune is the most efficient path. Whisper offers a good starting point, even if it doesn't have perfect out-of-the-box Georgian support. Fine-tuning bridges the gap between the general capabilities of a model and the specific demands of the Georgian language. There are other alternative models available, you may need to experiment.</Description>
      <Steps>
        <Step1_ChooseModel>
          <Title>1. Model Selection</Title>
          <Actions>
            *   **Whisper (OpenAI):** Start with OpenAI's Whisper model, particularly the "small" or "medium" versions. Despite not being perfectly tailored for Georgian initially, its strong general speech recognition capabilities and open availability for fine-tuning make it an excellent base.
            *   **Alternatives:** Explore other open-source models like those based on the QuartzNet or Wav2Vec architectures, searching specifically for implementations with multilingual support or the potential for fine-tuning with new languages.
          </Actions>
          <Rationale>
            Whisper's popularity, ease of use with libraries like `transformers`, and strong transfer learning capabilities provide a solid foundation. Its relative size allows for training on accessible hardware.  Explore other options if Whisper proves insufficient after initial tests.

        </Step1_ChooseModel>
        <Step2_SetupEnvironment>
          <Title>2. Environment Setup</Title>
          <Actions>
            *   **Install Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
            *   **Install Libraries:** Install the necessary libraries: `torch`, `transformers`, `datasets`, `torchaudio`, and any other dependencies for your chosen model. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` if the model provides a `requirements.txt` file.
            *   **GPU Access:** Ideally, use a GPU for faster training. Set up CUDA if you have an NVIDIA GPU. Cloud platforms like Google Colab provide free GPU access.
          </Actions>

        <Step3_FineTune>
          <Title>3. Fine-Tuning</Title>
          <Actions>
            *   **Prepare Data:** Format your dataset to be compatible with the chosen model. This often involves creating a training and validation split and converting the data into a format that the model's training script can read.
            *   **Training:** Use the model's training script (often available in the model's repository or documentation) to fine-tune the model on your Georgian dataset. Monitor the training loss and validation accuracy to ensure the model is learning effectively. Adjust hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.) as needed. Consider techniques like "low-resource fine-tuning" if your dataset is relatively small.
            *   **Evaluation:** After training, evaluate the model's performance on a held-out test set. Use metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) to quantify the accuracy of the transcription.
          </Actions>
          <Deliverables>

      <Steps>
        <Step1_Integration>
          <Title>1. Integration into Workflow</Title>
          <Actions>
            *   **API Endpoint:** Wrap the trained model in an API endpoint using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI. This allows you to send audio data to the server and receive transcribed text in return.
            *   **Command-Line Tool:** Create a command-line tool that allows users to transcribe audio files from their terminal.
            *   **n8n Integration:** As you mentioned n8n, create a custom node that utilizes the API endpoint or command-line tool to automate Georgian speech-to-text transcription within your n8n workflows.
          </Actions>
          <Deliverables>

        <Step2_Optimization>
          <Title>2. Optimization</Title>
          <Actions>
            *   **Quantization:** Reduce the model's size by quantizing the weights. This can significantly reduce memory usage and improve inference speed, with a potential trade-off in accuracy. `torch.quantization` provides tools for this.
            *   **Pruning:** Remove less important connections from the model to reduce its complexity and improve speed.
            *   **ONNX Runtime:** Convert the model to ONNX format for faster inference using ONNX Runtime.

        <Step3_ContinuousImprovement>
          <Title>3. Continuous Improvement</Title>
          <Actions>
            *   **Active Learning:** Implement active learning techniques to select the most informative samples for manual transcription and fine-tuning. This helps to improve the model's accuracy with less data.
            *   **User Feedback:** Collect user feedback on the accuracy of the transcriptions. Use this feedback to identify areas where the model is struggling and to prioritize data collection and fine-tuning efforts.
            *   **Regular Retraining:** Retrain the model periodically with new data to maintain its accuracy and adapt to changes in the Georgian language.
