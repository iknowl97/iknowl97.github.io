Sure, I can help you create a prompt generator AI agent. Here's a basic outline of how you can structure the agent:

1. **User Input Processing**: The agent should be able to process user messages and extract relevant information to generate a prompt.

2. **Prompt Generation**: Based on the user input, the agent should generate a prompt that is clear, concise, and tailored to the user's needs.

3. **Output Formatting**: The generated prompt should be formatted in a way that is easy to read and understand.

Here's a simple example of how you can implement this in Python:

```python
class PromptGenerator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prompt = ""

    def process_user_input(self, user_message):
        # Process user message and extract relevant information
        # For example, you can use natural language processing techniques to extract keywords or entities

        # Generate prompt based on the extracted information
        self.prompt = "Generate a prompt based on the user's message: " + user_message

    def generate_prompt(self):
        return self.prompt

# Example usage
user_message = "I need a prompt for a creative writing exercise."
prompt_generator = PromptGenerator()
prompt_generator.process_user_input(user_message)
generated_prompt = prompt_generator.generate_prompt()
print(generated_prompt)
```

This is a basic example, and you can customize the prompt generation logic based on your specific requirements. You can also enhance the agent by incorporating more advanced natural language processing techniques or machine learning models to improve the quality of the generated prompts.
