  <OriginalPrompt>
    The primary goal is to generate a prompt that configures a smart alarm clock to perform specific actions based on user-defined conditions and preferences. The alarm clock agent should be able to handle requests related to setting alarms, snoozing, customizing alarm sounds, integrating with weather forecasts, adjusting volume levels, and incorporating smart home device controls.
  </OriginalPrompt>
  <Goal>To create a comprehensive and adaptable prompt for configuring a smart alarm clock, encompassing basic and advanced functionalities, customization options, and robust error handling, ensuring user-friendly interaction and maximizing the alarm's utility.</Goal>
  <Context>
    You are creating a prompt that will be used to control a smart alarm clock system. This system is capable of setting alarms with different parameters, such as time, day, and recurring schedules. It can also integrate with external services like weather forecasts and smart home devices. Consider various user scenarios, including those with limited technical expertise.
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Step>1. **Basic Alarm Setting:** Create instructions for setting a simple alarm. Specify the time (including AM/PM), day (day of the week, specific date, or "today"), and recurrence (once, daily, weekdays, weekends, custom schedule). Ensure instructions are clear for users with varying technical skills.</Step>
    <Step>2. **Advanced Alarm Options:** Incorporate advanced features such as weather integration (if rain/snow/sunshine is predicted), traffic integration (if commute time exceeds a threshold), smart home device control (turn on lights, adjust thermostat, start coffee maker), and custom snooze settings. Provide clear examples for each feature.</Step>
    <Step>3. **Customization and Preferences:** Allow users to customize the alarm sound (specify sound name or file path), volume (percentage or level), brightness, vibration (intensity and pattern), and other preferences. Provide a range of options and explain how to adjust each setting.</Step>
    <Step>4. **Error Handling and Fallbacks:** Specify how the system should respond to invalid or ambiguous commands. Provide examples of common errors (e.g., missing time, invalid date) and the appropriate responses (e.g., prompt for missing information, suggest alternatives). Define a fallback procedure if an unexpected error occurs (e.g., notify user, suggest alternatives, log error for debugging).</Step>
    <Step>5. **Context Awareness:** Enable the alarm to adapt based on external context, such as holidays (do not activate), location (adjust time zone), or user activity (detect sleep patterns and adjust wake-up time). Ensure the alarm is aware of and responds appropriately to these contextual factors.</Step>
    <Step>6. **Voice Command Optimization:** Optimize the prompt for voice command recognition. Consider variations in phrasing and pronunciation. Provide a list of common voice commands and their corresponding actions.</Step>
    <Step>7. **Multiple Alarm Profiles:** Allow users to create and manage multiple alarm profiles (e.g., "Workday," "Weekend," "Vacation"). Each profile should have its own settings and schedule. Provide instructions for creating, editing, and activating profiles.</Step>
    <Step>8. **Sleep Tracking Integration:** Integrate with sleep tracking devices to analyze sleep patterns and optimize wake-up time. Allow the alarm to gently wake the user during a light sleep phase.</Step>
    <Step>9. **Personalized Wake-up Routines:** Allow users to create personalized wake-up routines that include a series of actions (e.g., play music, read news headlines, display weather forecast). Provide instructions for customizing and activating routines.</Step>
    <Step>10. **Security Considerations:** Address security considerations, such as preventing unauthorized access to alarm settings and ensuring data privacy. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user data.</Step>

  <Examples>
    <Example>
      <Input>Set an alarm for 8:00 AM on Sunday.</Input>
      <Output>Alarm set for Sunday at 8:00 AM.</Output>
    </Example>
    <Example>
      <Input>Set an alarm for 6:00 AM every weekday. If it's a holiday, do not activate the alarm.</Input>
      <Output>Alarm set for 6:00 AM on weekdays. Alarm will be skipped on recognized holidays.</Output>
    </Example>
    <Example>
      <Input>Change the alarm sound to "ocean waves" and increase the volume to 80%.</Input>
      <Output>Alarm sound changed to "ocean waves" and volume set to 80%.</Output>
    </Example>
    <Example>
      <Input>Set an alarm for 7:30 AM. If there is a traffic delay of more than 30 minutes on my commute, wake me up 15 minutes earlier.</Input>
      <Output>Alarm set for 7:30 AM. If commute delay exceeds 30 minutes, alarm will be triggered 15 minutes early.</Output>
    </Example>
    <Example>
      <Input>If the user says "Set an alarm for tomorrow morning",</Input>
      <Output>respond with "What time would you like to set the alarm for?".</Output>
    </Example>
