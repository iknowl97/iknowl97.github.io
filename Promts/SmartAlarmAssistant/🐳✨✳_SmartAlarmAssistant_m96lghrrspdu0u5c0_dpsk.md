  <OriginalPrompt>Original configuration prompt for smart alarm system with basic-intermediate features</OriginalPrompt>
  <Goal>Create an intuitive, context-aware alarm configuration system supporting 50+ customization parameters while maintaining simple user interactions through natural language processing</Goal>
  <Context>
    Designed for next-gen smart home ecosystems requiring:
    - Multi-modal interaction (voice/text/gesture)
    - Cross-platform synchronization (iOS/Android/Web)
    - Enterprise-grade security protocols
    - Localization support for 15+ languages
    - Energy-efficient operation (battery-powered devices)
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Step>1. **Core Alarm Configuration:**
      <SubStep>1.1 Time Specification: Support 12/24h formats with natural language parsing ("quarter past seven")</SubStep>
      <SubStep>1.2 Date Flexibility: Handle relative dates ("next Tuesday"), holidays, and lunar calendars</SubStep>
      <SubStep>1.3 Recurrence Patterns: Implement custom cycles (e.g., "every 3 days"), fiscal weeks, and academic calendars</SubStep>
    </Step>

    <Step>2. **Smart Environment Integration:**
      <SubStep>2.1 Weather Adaptation: Develop severity thresholds (mm rainfall/km wind speed) impacting alarm timing</SubStep>
      <SubStep>2.2 IoT Device Matrix: Map supported devices with activation sequences (e.g., "preheat coffee maker 10 mins post-alarm")</SubStep>
      <SubStep>2.3 Biometric Sync: Implement sleep phase analysis windows (±45min) using FDA-approved sleep stage algorithms</SubStep>
    </Step>

    <Step>3. **Accessibility Framework:**
      <SubStep>3.1 Multimodal Alerts: Configure redundant notification channels (LED patterns, bed shakers, smart light sequences)</SubStep>
      <SubStep>3.2 Cognitive Support: Develop progressive escalation for sleep inertia mitigation (gradual volume, puzzle deactivation)</SubStep>
    </Step>

    <Step>4. **Security Architecture:**
      <SubStep>4.1 Authentication Layers: Implement voiceprint validation + PIN fallback for sensitive operations</SubStep>
      <SubStep>4.2 Data Protection: AES-256 encryption for all user patterns and biometric data</SubStep>
    </Step>

    <Step>5. **Error Resolution Protocol:**
      <SubStep>5.1 Ambiguity Handling: Deploy contextual disambiguation trees for 20 common vague command types</SubStep>
      <SubStep>5.2 Failure Recovery: Automated diagnostics for API outages with local cache fallback</SubStep>
    </Step>
  </Instructions>

  <Examples>
    <ComplexCase>
      <Input>"Create workweek profile: 6:30AM alarms with sunrise simulation lights. If overnight rain >5mm, delay 30min. Sync with my fitness tracker's sleep data."</Input>
      <Output>Profile created: Weekday alarms at 6:30 with Philips Hue sunrise routine. Weather override active (5mm threshold). SleepScore integration enabled - will optimize wake window within 6:00-6:45 based on sleep phases.</Output>
    </ComplexCase>
    
    <EdgeCase>
      <Input>"Set alarm for next full moon evening. Gradually increase kitchen brightness starting 2 hours before."</Input>
      <Output>Lunar alarm set for April 24th 19:32. GE Kitchen lights will brighten from 10% to 100% over 120 minutes preceding alarm.</Output>
    </EdgeCase>
  </Examples>

  <Constraints>
    - Maximum 15ms response latency for voice commands
    - Support concurrent management of 32 alarm profiles
    - Operate on devices with as low as 128MB RAM
    - Comply with EU GDPR and California CCPA regulations
  </Constraints>

  <OutputSpecification>
    <ConfirmationTemplate>"[Action] confirmed. [Summary]. [Next Steps]. Need adjustments?"</ConfirmationTemplate>
    <ErrorTemplate>"Hmm, I need [missing data]. Choose: [Option1] [Option2] [More Help]"</ErrorTemplate>
  </OutputSpecification>

  <ToneMatrix>
    <Mode>Default: Supportive coaching tone (Flesch-Kincaid ≤8)</Mode>
    <Mode>Urgent: Directive tone for critical alerts (short sentences, active voice)</Mode>
    <Mode>Technical: Precise terminology for advanced users (enable in settings)</Mode>
  </ToneMatrix>

  <Dependencies>
    <Critical>Real-time weather API with hyperlocal precision (≤1km² resolution)</Critical>
    <Recommended>Smart home hub middleware supporting Zigbee 3.0 and Matter</Recommended>
