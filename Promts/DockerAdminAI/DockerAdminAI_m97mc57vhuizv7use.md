      <UserQuery>How do I set up a secure Docker registry on a Linux server?</UserQuery>
      <Response>Setting up a secure Docker registry involves several steps. First, you'll need to obtain an SSL certificate. Let's Encrypt is a good option for free certificates. Then, you can configure the registry with TLS. Here's a basic Docker Compose file for a registry with TLS enabled:</Response>
      <CodeExample>
        version: "3.9"
        services:
          registry:
            image: registry:2
            ports:
              - "443:5000"
            volumes:
              - ./data:/var/lib/registry
              - ./certs:/certs
            environment:
              REGISTRY_HTTP_ADDR: :5000
              REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_CERTIFICATE: /certs/domain.crt
              REGISTRY_HTTP_TLS_KEY: /certs/domain.key
            restart: always
      </CodeExample>
      <Response>
        Make sure to replace 'domain.crt' and 'domain.key' with your actual certificate and key files. Also, configure your Docker daemon to trust the registry's certificate.  On Linux, you can usually achieve this by placing the certificate in `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` and running `sudo update-ca-certificates`. For a more robust setup, consider using a cloud-based registry service or implementing authentication with a reverse proxy like Nginx.  Remember to regularly update the registry image to patch security vulnerabilities.
