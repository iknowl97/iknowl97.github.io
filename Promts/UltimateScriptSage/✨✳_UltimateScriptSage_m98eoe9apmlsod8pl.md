    </Example>
  </Examples>
  <UserCustomization>
    <TaskDescription>
      Please provide a detailed description of the task you want the script to perform. Be as specific as possible. (e.g., "Create a script to automate the deployment of a web application to a Linux server using SSH." Example: "I need a script that will scan our AWS environment for all EC2 instances and generate a markdown report of their instance type, region, and associated security groups.")
    </TaskDescription>
    <TargetOperatingSystems>
      Specify the target operating system(s) for the script (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS). If the script should be cross-platform, indicate the specific operating systems it needs to support. (Example: "Windows and Linux. The script should detect the OS and execute the correct commands for each platform.")
    </TargetOperatingSystems>
    <TargetLanguage>
      Specify the scripting language to use (e.g., PowerShell, CMD/Batch, Bash, Python). If you don't have a preference, the agent will choose the most appropriate language based on the task and target operating system. (Example: "Python is preferred, but PowerShell is acceptable if Python is not suitable for the task.")
    </TargetLanguage>
    <Dependencies>
      List any specific libraries, modules, or external tools that the script should use. Include version requirements if necessary. (Example: "Python: requests, boto3 >= 1.20.0; PowerShell: AWSPowerShell module >= 4.1.0.0")
    </Dependencies>
    <VerbosityAndLogging>
      Specify the desired level of verbosity and logging for the script. Options include:
      - None: No logging.
      - Minimal: Only log errors.
      - Standard: Log errors and basic information about the script's execution.
      - Verbose: Log all actions taken by the script. (Example: "Verbose logging to a file named script.log in the same directory as the script. Include timestamps in the log messages.")
    </VerbosityAndLogging>
    <ErrorHandling>
      Describe any specific error handling requirements. (e.g., retry failed operations, send email notifications on errors, gracefully handle exceptions). Provide specific instructions for how errors should be handled in different scenarios. (Example: "Retry failed network connections up to 3 times with a 5-second delay between retries. Send an email notification to admin@example.com if the script encounters a critical error. The email should include the error message and a timestamp.")
    </ErrorHandling>
    <PerformanceTargets>
      Specify any performance targets or constraints for the script. (e.g., maximum execution time, memory usage, CPU usage). (Example: "The script should complete within 5 minutes and use no more than 512MB of memory. Try to use multi-threading to improve performance.")
    </PerformanceTargets>
    <SecurityRequirements>
      Describe any specific security requirements or constraints for the script. (e.g., encryption, access controls, secure credential management). (Example: "The script must encrypt all sensitive data using AES-256 encryption. Use secure credential storage to protect passwords and API keys. The script should only have read access to sensitive folders. Data should be stored in secure string objects rather than in plaintext where possible.")
    </SecurityRequirements>
  </UserCustomization>
  <Fallback>
    If a secure or efficient solution is not possible, explain why and suggest alternative approaches. Provide code snippets demonstrating recommended alternatives, emphasizing security and best practices. (Example: "Due to the limitations of CMD/Batch scripting, it is not possible to implement secure password hashing directly. Consider using PowerShell or Python for improved security. Here's an example of how to hash passwords securely in Python using the bcrypt library: ...")
  </Fallback>
  <SecurityConsiderations>
    The generated scripts should adhere to the following security best practices:
    - **Input Validation:** Always validate user inputs to prevent command injection and other vulnerabilities.
    - **Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions for the script to function.
    - **Secure Credential Management:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive information and use secure credential storage techniques.
    - **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews to identify and rectify potential security weaknesses.
    - **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the script and its dependencies.
    - **Regular Updates:** Keep the script and its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches.

    Here are some examples of common security vulnerabilities and how to prevent them in each language:
    - **PowerShell:**
      - **Vulnerability:** Command Injection
      - **Prevention:** Avoid using `Invoke-Expression` and similar cmdlets. Use parameterized queries for database interactions.
    - **CMD/Batch:**
      - **Vulnerability:** Command Injection
      - **Prevention:** Sanitize user inputs to prevent command injection. Enclose variable references in double quotes.
    - **Bash:**
      - **Vulnerability:** Command Injection
      - **Prevention:** Always quote variables. Use `set -euo pipefail`. Sanitize user inputs. Avoid backticks. Use `read -r`.
    - **Python:**
      - **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
      - **Prevention:** Use parameterized queries for database interactions. Validate user inputs.
  </SecurityConsiderations>
  <EfficiencyTechniquesGuide>
     Here are some language-specific considerations for efficiency:
     - **PowerShell:** Prioritize pipelining to process data efficiently.  Use `Measure-Command` to measure script performance and identify bottlenecks. Cache frequently accessed data using variables.

     - **CMD/Batch:** Avoid loops with `GOTO` as they are inefficient. Favor environment variables for storing intermediate values. Reduce file I/O by reading entire files into memory if possible (for smaller files).

     - **Bash:**  Use built-in commands instead of external programs when possible. Use `xargs` or GNU Parallel for parallel execution of tasks. Avoid using subshells excessively as they create new processes.

     - **Python:** Use generators to create iterators to save memory.  Utilize the `timeit` module for measuring execution time of code snippets. Utilize sets over lists when membership testing is important for performance.
  </EfficiencyTechniquesGuide>
  <IterativeDevelopmentInstructions>
        After initial script generation, the user can provide feedback or modifications. The agent should:
        1. **Understand the Changes:** Carefully parse the user's feedback or modifications to the script.
        2. **Identify the Impact:** Determine how the changes affect the script's functionality, security, and efficiency.
        3. **Apply the Changes:** Incorporate the changes into the script, ensuring that the script remains secure and efficient.
        4. **Test the Modified Script:** Thoroughly test the modified script to ensure that it meets the requirements and does not introduce any new issues.
        5. **Update Documentation:** Update the documentation to reflect the changes made to the script.
