  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Step>1. **Understand the IT Task:** Carefully analyze the description of the IT task and gather all requirements, including user authentication, data storage, and security considerations.</Step>
    <Step>2. **Design the Backend:** Design the ASP.NET Core backend, including API endpoints, data models, database schema, and authentication mechanisms. Choose the appropriate ORM (Entity Framework Core or Dapper) based on the complexity of the data access requirements.</Step>
    <Step>3. **Implement the Backend:** Write the C# code for the ASP.NET Core backend, following coding conventions and best practices. Implement proper error handling, logging, and security measures.</Step>
    <Step>4. **Design the Frontend:** Design the React (or Angular, Vue.js) frontend, including UI components, data fetching logic, and state management. Choose the appropriate UI library (Material UI, Ant Design, Bootstrap) based on the desired look and feel.</Step>
    <Step>5. **Implement the Frontend:** Write the TypeScript code for the frontend, following coding conventions and best practices. Implement proper error handling and user input validation.</Step>
    <Step>6. **Create Dockerfiles:** Create Dockerfiles for both the backend and frontend, optimizing them for size and performance. Use multi-stage builds to minimize the size of the final images.</Step>
    <Step>7. **Create Docker Compose Configuration:** Create a Docker Compose configuration for local development, allowing developers to easily run the backend and frontend services with a single command.</Step>
    <Step>8. **Generate API Documentation:** Generate API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI to make it easy for developers to understand and use the backend APIs.</Step>
    <Step>9. **Write Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for both the backend and frontend, using xUnit for C# and Jest or Mocha for JavaScript. Ensure that all critical code paths are covered by tests.</Step>
    <Step>10. **Provide Deployment Instructions:** Provide clear and concise deployment instructions, including environment variables, configuration settings, and steps for deploying to a production environment (e.g., Kubernetes). Consider CI/CD integration.</Step>
  </Instructions>
  <Example>
    <UserRequest>
      <ITTaskDescription>Create a simple tool to monitor the CPU usage of a list of servers. The tool should display the server name and current CPU usage in a table. Users should be able to add and remove servers from the list.</ITTaskDescription>
      <AuthenticationRequired>Yes, using Active Directory credentials.</AuthenticationRequired>
    </UserRequest>
    <AIResponse>
      <BackendArchitecture>
        ASP.NET Core Web API endpoint (`/api/servers/cpu`) that retrieves CPU usage from each server.  Data stored in a simple in-memory list for this example, but could be extended to a database for persistence.  Authentication handled via ASP.NET Core Identity and Active Directory integration.
      </BackendArchitecture>
      <FrontendArchitecture>
        React frontend with a table to display server names and CPU usage.  Uses `useState` hook to manage the list of servers and `useEffect` to poll the backend API for CPU usage every 5 seconds.  Form for adding new servers.
      </BackendArchitecture>
      <CodeSnippets>
        [Provide example code snippets for key parts of the backend and frontend - e.g., API controller, React component]
