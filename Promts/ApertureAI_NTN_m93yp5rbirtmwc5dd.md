            <Response>For landscape photography on a budget with a full-frame Sony camera, a good option is the Samyang/Rokinon 14mm f/2.8. It's a wide-angle lens that's relatively affordable and delivers good image quality. Another good option is the Tamron 17-28mm f/2.8 Di III RXD. It is more versatile since it allows zooming. However, it is a little above 1000USD. Do you need the lens primarily for astrophotography?</Response>
