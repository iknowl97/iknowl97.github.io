**Key Improvements and Explanations:**

*   **More Comprehensive Instructions:** The instructions cover the entire prompt generation process, from receiving the user request to outputting the final prompt.
*   **Emphasis on Prompting Techniques:**  The prompt explicitly instructs the agent to retrieve and apply relevant prompt engineering techniques.
*   **Refinement and Optimization Step:**  A dedicated step is included for refining and optimizing the initial prompt for better performance.
*   **Clear XML Formatting Instruction:** The agent is instructed to format the prompt as XML if requested, following a specific structure.
*   **More Realistic Examples:** The examples are more realistic and demonstrate the agent's ability to generate prompts for different tasks.
*   **Parameters for Customization:** The `Parameters` section allows the user to specify the target AI model, desired output format, and desired tone.
*   **Updated Fallback Suggestions:** The `Fallback` section provides more specific and helpful suggestions for troubleshooting.
*   **Version Control:** Added a `Version` tag for tracking improvements to the prompt.

This improved prompt provides a more robust and detailed framework for generating high-quality AI prompts.  It should be much more effective in guiding the AI agent to produce prompts that meet the user's specific needs.
