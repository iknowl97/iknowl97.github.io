      <Goal>Create an optimized `docker-compose.yml` file for deploying Ollama with main and embedding models, exposing the API for local network access, specifically tailored for integration with n8n.</Goal>
      <Context>The user is a system administrator experienced with Docker and seeks a robust `docker-compose.yml` setup. The setup should include Ollama, facilitate access to both general-purpose and embedding models, ensure the Ollama API is accessible from the local network, and provide clear guidance on integrating the embedding models into n8n workflows.</Context>
      <Instructions>
        <Step>1. **Define Docker Compose Version:** Start the `docker-compose.yml` file with the version declaration. Use version `3.8` for compatibility and modern features.</Step>
        <Step>2. **Ollama Service Definition:**  Define the `ollama` service. This service will be the core of the Ollama deployment. Configure the following:
          *   **Image:** Use the official Ollama Docker image, `ollama/ollama:latest` to get the latest version.
          *   **Ports:** Map port `11434` from the container to the host. This exposes the Ollama API on the local network, using the format `"11434:11434"`.
          *   **Volumes:** Create a persistent volume named `ollama_data` and mount it to `/root/.ollama` inside the container. This ensures that downloaded models persist across container restarts.
          *   **Environment Variables:** Set the `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable to `0.0.0.0` to allow access from any address on the local network. This is crucial for n8n to connect to the Ollama API.
          *   **Restart Policy:** Set `restart: always` to automatically restart the container if it fails, ensuring high availability.
        </Step>
        <Step>3. **Volume Definition:** Define the `ollama_data` volume. This named volume will store the downloaded Ollama models, preventing data loss when the container is stopped or removed.</Step>
        <Step>4. **Embedding Model Configuration:** Add a comment block providing instructions for pulling embedding models.
          *   Explain that the user needs to explicitly pull the desired embedding models using `ollama pull`.
          *   Provide example models like `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` and `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text`.
          *   Emphasize that the choice of embedding model depends on the specific requirements of their n8n workflows.
        </Step>
        <Step>5. **N8n Integration Guide:**  Add a detailed comment block explaining how to integrate the Ollama embedding models with n8n. This guide should include:
          *   The need to use the HTTP Request node in n8n.
          *   Instructions to configure the HTTP Request node to send a `POST` request to `http://<ollama-host>:11434/api/embeddings`.
          *   An example JSON body for the request: `{"model": "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2", "prompt": "Your text to embed"}`.  Explain that `<ollama-host>` should be replaced with the actual hostname or IP address where Ollama is running (or the Docker service name if n8n and ollama are on the same docker network).
          *   Instructions on how to process the response from the Ollama API within the n8n workflow.
        </Step>
        <Step>6. **Resource Limits (Optional):** Include a commented-out section demonstrating how to set resource limits (CPU and memory) for the Ollama container. This is important for managing resources on the host system, especially in production environments.  Explain that the values should be adjusted based on the available resources and the load on the Ollama instance.
        </Step>
        <Step>7. **Complete YAML Structure:** Combine all the steps into a valid and well-formatted `docker-compose.yml` file.</Step>
        <Step>8. **Output XML:** Enclose the complete `docker-compose.yml` file content within `<file>` tags. Ensure the YAML is correctly formatted and easily copyable by the user.</Step>
      </Instructions>
      <Example>
        <UserInput>I want a docker-compose file for ollama with embedding models for n8n.</UserInput>
        <Response>
          ```xml
          <file>
version: '3.8'
services:
  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:latest
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"
    volumes:
      - ollama_data:/root/.ollama
    environment:
      OLLAMA_HOST: 0.0.0.0
    restart: always
    #  If you want to limit resources, uncomment and adjust the following:
    #  deploy:
    #    resources:
    #      limits:
    #        cpus: '2'   # Limit to 2 CPUs
    #        memory: 4G  # Limit to 4GB of memory

volumes:
  ollama_data:

# NOTE: You'll need to pull specific embedding models using `ollama pull`.
#       For example: `ollama pull sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` or `ollama pull nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text`
#       Choose models compatible with your n8n workflows.
#
# To use the embedding models in n8n:
# 1. Use the HTTP Request node.
# 2. Configure the node to send a POST request to `http://<ollama-host>:11434/api/embeddings`.  Replace <ollama-host> with the correct address. If n8n and Ollama are in the same Docker network, you might be able to use the service name `ollama` as the host.
# 3. Include the following JSON body:
#    { "model": "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2", "prompt": "Your text to embed" }
# 4. Process the response from the API. The response will contain the embedding vector.

          </file>
          ```
        </Response>
      </Example>
      <Considerations>
        - This `docker-compose.yml` assumes that Docker and Docker Compose are already installed and configured on the user's system.
        - The user needs to replace `<ollama-host>` with the actual hostname or IP address of the machine running the Ollama container. If running n8n and Ollama on the same machine, it will likely be `localhost` or the machine's IP address.  If they are both running within Docker containers on the same Docker network, the Docker service name (`ollama`) might be resolvable.
        - The user must choose and `ollama pull` the appropriate embedding models based on their specific requirements and the capabilities of their n8n workflows.  The example models are only suggestions. Other models that are compatible with ollama are also available for download and use.
        - The resource limits section is optional but highly recommended for production deployments to prevent resource exhaustion. Adjust the CPU and memory limits based on the available resources and the expected load.
        - The user is responsible for ensuring that the network configuration allows n8n to communicate with the Ollama API. This might involve configuring firewall rules or Docker network settings.

  </OriginalPrompt>
  <Goal>To generate a highly optimized and production-ready `docker-compose.yml` file for deploying Ollama with enhanced instructions for embedding model integration within n8n workflows, ensuring clarity, security, and best practices are followed.</Goal>
  <Context>The target user is a DevOps engineer or system administrator with intermediate-to-advanced Docker knowledge, seeking a streamlined and secure deployment of Ollama for integration with n8n. The focus is on providing a `docker-compose.yml` file that is easy to customize, secure by default, and provides clear guidance on the nuances of integrating Ollama embedding models into n8n workflows, including error handling and best practices.</Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Step>1. **Docker Compose Version and Network Definition:** Start with the `docker-compose.yml` version (3.8).  Define a dedicated Docker network for Ollama and n8n to isolate them. This enhances security and simplifies inter-container communication. Name the network "ollama-n8n".</Step>
    <Step>2. **Ollama Service Definition (Enhanced):**
      *   **Image:** Use `ollama/ollama:latest`.
      *   **Container Name:** Specify `container_name: ollama` for easier identification and management.
      *   **Ports:** Map port `11434` to the host, `11434:11434`.
      *   **Volumes:** Mount the `ollama_data` volume to `/root/.ollama`.
      *   **Environment Variables:** Set `OLLAMA_HOST: 0.0.0.0`. Also, consider adding `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*` to allow requests from any origin, if necessary (but warn about security implications in the comments - see step 7).  If possible, avoid using `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*` and configure CORS properly on n8n or use a reverse proxy.
      *   **Restart Policy:** `restart: always`.
      *   **Network:** Attach the service to the `ollama-n8n` network.
    </Step>
    <Step>3. **N8n Service Definition (Placeholder):** Include a commented-out placeholder for the n8n service, demonstrating how it would be configured to connect to Ollama. This section should include:
      *   `image: n8nio/n8n`
      *   `ports: - "5678:5678"`
      *   `environment: - N8N_HOST=n8n - N8N_PORT=5678`  (explain these are examples and might need adjustment)
      *   `network: - ollama-n8n`
      *   `depends_on: - ollama` (this is crucial for ensuring n8n starts after Ollama).
    </Step>
    <Step>4. **Volume Definition:** Define the `ollama_data` volume.</Step>
    <Step>5. **Embedding Model Configuration (Detailed):** Expand the embedding model configuration section. Provide links to the Ollama model library or relevant documentation for finding suitable models. Include a warning about pulling models from untrusted sources. Explain the importance of verifying model checksums (if available) for security. Add a recommendation to use tagged versions instead of `latest` for models to improve stability and reproducibility.</Step>
    <Step>6. **N8n Integration Guide (Advanced):**
      *   Provide a more detailed guide on using the HTTP Request node in n8n, including instructions on setting the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.
      *   Expand the example JSON body to include more parameters that might be relevant, such as `stream: false` (if streaming is not desired).
      *   Explain how to handle potential errors from the Ollama API (e.g., using the "Respond on Error" option in the HTTP Request node).
      *   Describe how to extract the embedding vector from the JSON response using n8n's expression language (e.g., `$json.embedding`).
      *   Mention the possibility of using n8n's "Function" node to perform more complex data transformations on the embedding vector.
    </Step>
    <Step>7. **Security Considerations:** Add a prominent comment block dedicated to security. This section should:
      *   Warn about the risks of using `OLLAMA_ORIGINS=*` and recommend avoiding it if possible. Suggest alternative solutions like configuring CORS properly on n8n or using a reverse proxy.
      *   Emphasize the importance of securing the n8n instance itself, as it will have access to the Ollama API.
      *   Recommend using Docker secrets for storing sensitive information, such as API keys or passwords, instead of environment variables.
      *   Highlight the importance of keeping both Ollama and n8n up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    </Step>
    <Step>8. **Resource Limits and Monitoring:** Include the commented-out resource limits section.  Add recommendations for monitoring Ollama's resource usage using Docker stats or other monitoring tools. Suggest setting up alerts for high CPU or memory usage.</Step>
    <Step>9. **Complete YAML Structure:** Generate the complete, well-formatted `docker-compose.yml` file, incorporating all the above improvements.</Step>
    <Step>10. **Output XML:** Enclose the `docker-compose.yml` file content within `<file>` tags.</Step>
    <Step>11. **Clarification Questions for the User:** Include the following clarification questions in the &lt;ClarificationQuestions&gt; tag:
    * "Do you have any specific resource constraints (CPU/Memory) for the Ollama container?"
    * "What type of data transformations will be performed on the embedding vectors within n8n?"
    * "Do you plan to expose the n8n instance to the public internet, or will it be used internally?"
    * "Do you have specific embedding models in mind, or do you need suggestions based on your n8n workflows?"
    * "Will n8n and Ollama be on the same machine or different machines?"</Step>
