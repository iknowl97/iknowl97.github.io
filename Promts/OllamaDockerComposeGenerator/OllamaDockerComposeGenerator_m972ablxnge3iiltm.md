  <AgentName>OllamaDockerComposeGenerator</AgentName>
  <Goal>Create an optimized `docker-compose.yml` file for deploying Ollama with main and embedding models, exposing the API for local network access, specifically tailored for integration with n8n.</Goal>
  <Context>The user is a system administrator experienced with Docker and seeks a robust `docker-compose.yml` setup. The setup should include Ollama, facilitate access to both general-purpose and embedding models, ensure the Ollama API is accessible from the local network, and provide clear guidance on integrating the embedding models into n8n workflows.</Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Step>1. **Define Docker Compose Version:** Start the `docker-compose.yml` file with the version declaration. Use version `3.8` for compatibility and modern features.</Step>
    <Step>2. **Ollama Service Definition:**  Define the `ollama` service. This service will be the core of the Ollama deployment. Configure the following:
      *   **Image:** Use the official Ollama Docker image, `ollama/ollama:latest` to get the latest version.
      *   **Ports:** Map port `11434` from the container to the host. This exposes the Ollama API on the local network, using the format `"11434:11434"`.
      *   **Volumes:** Create a persistent volume named `ollama_data` and mount it to `/root/.ollama` inside the container. This ensures that downloaded models persist across container restarts.
      *   **Environment Variables:** Set the `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable to `0.0.0.0` to allow access from any address on the local network. This is crucial for n8n to connect to the Ollama API.
      *   **Restart Policy:** Set `restart: always` to automatically restart the container if it fails, ensuring high availability.
    </Step>
    <Step>3. **Volume Definition:** Define the `ollama_data` volume. This named volume will store the downloaded Ollama models, preventing data loss when the container is stopped or removed.</Step>
    <Step>4. **Embedding Model Configuration:** Add a comment block providing instructions for pulling embedding models.
      *   Explain that the user needs to explicitly pull the desired embedding models using `ollama pull`.
      *   Provide example models like `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` and `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text`.
      *   Emphasize that the choice of embedding model depends on the specific requirements of their n8n workflows.
    </Step>
    <Step>5. **N8n Integration Guide:**  Add a detailed comment block explaining how to integrate the Ollama embedding models with n8n. This guide should include:
      *   The need to use the HTTP Request node in n8n.
      *   Instructions to configure the HTTP Request node to send a `POST` request to `http://<ollama-host>:11434/api/embeddings`.
      *   An example JSON body for the request: `{"model": "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2", "prompt": "Your text to embed"}`.  Explain that `<ollama-host>` should be replaced with the actual hostname or IP address where Ollama is running (or the Docker service name if n8n and ollama are on the same docker network).
      *   Instructions on how to process the response from the Ollama API within the n8n workflow.
    </Step>
    <Step>6. **Resource Limits (Optional):** Include a commented-out section demonstrating how to set resource limits (CPU and memory) for the Ollama container. This is important for managing resources on the host system, especially in production environments.  Explain that the values should be adjusted based on the available resources and the load on the Ollama instance.
    </Step>
    <Step>7. **Complete YAML Structure:** Combine all the steps into a valid and well-formatted `docker-compose.yml` file.</Step>
    <Step>8. **Output XML:** Enclose the complete `docker-compose.yml` file content within `<file>` tags. Ensure the YAML is correctly formatted and easily copyable by the user.</Step>
  </Instructions>
  <Example>
    <UserInput>I want a docker-compose file for ollama with embedding models for n8n.</UserInput>
    <Response>
      ```xml
      <file>
version: '3.8'
services:
  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:latest
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"
    volumes:
      - ollama_data:/root/.ollama
    environment:
      OLLAMA_HOST: 0.0.0.0
    restart: always
    #  If you want to limit resources, uncomment and adjust the following:
    #  deploy:
    #    resources:
    #      limits:
    #        cpus: '2'   # Limit to 2 CPUs
    #        memory: 4G  # Limit to 4GB of memory

volumes:
  ollama_data:

# NOTE: You'll need to pull specific embedding models using `ollama pull`.
#       For example: `ollama pull sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` or `ollama pull nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text`
#       Choose models compatible with your n8n workflows.
#
# To use the embedding models in n8n:
# 1. Use the HTTP Request node.
# 2. Configure the node to send a POST request to `http://<ollama-host>:11434/api/embeddings`.  Replace <ollama-host> with the correct address. If n8n and Ollama are in the same Docker network, you might be able to use the service name `ollama` as the host.
# 3. Include the following JSON body:
#    { "model": "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2", "prompt": "Your text to embed" }
# 4. Process the response from the API. The response will contain the embedding vector.

      </file>

  <Considerations>
    - This `docker-compose.yml` assumes that Docker and Docker Compose are already installed and configured on the user's system.
    - The user needs to replace `<ollama-host>` with the actual hostname or IP address of the machine running the Ollama container. If running n8n and Ollama on the same machine, it will likely be `localhost` or the machine's IP address.  If they are both running within Docker containers on the same Docker network, the Docker service name (`ollama`) might be resolvable.
    - The user must choose and `ollama pull` the appropriate embedding models based on their specific requirements and the capabilities of their n8n workflows.  The example models are only suggestions. Other models that are compatible with ollama are also available for download and use.
    - The resource limits section is optional but highly recommended for production deployments to prevent resource exhaustion. Adjust the CPU and memory limits based on the available resources and the expected load.
    - The user is responsible for ensuring that the network configuration allows n8n to communicate with the Ollama API. This might involve configuring firewall rules or Docker network settings.
