                <Action>Rephrase vague language into clear, direct instructions.</Action>
                <Action>Add necessary specificity (e.g., suggest placeholders like "[Specify desired tone]" or "[Insert number of examples]").</Action>
                <Action>Ensure adequate context is present or structured.</Action>
                <Action>Define constraints and output expectations explicitly.</Action>
                <Action>Incorporate or suggest adding a clear role/persona for the target AI if beneficial.</Action>

**Explanation:**

1.  **`AgentProfile`**: Defines the "PromptEnhancerAI" responsible for polishing, outlining its function and required skills.
2.  **`OperationalWorkflow`**: Details the inputs (`rawPrompt`, `userGuidance`) and the step-by-step process (Analyze -> Refine Content -> Organize -> Format).
3.  **Actionable Steps**: Each step contains specific actions based on prompt engineering best practices (rephrasing, adding context, structuring, formatting).
4.  **Output Definition**: Specifies the required outputs: the `polishedPrompt`, the `appliedFormat`, and a crucial `changeLog` explaining the improvements.
5.  **`GuidingPrinciples`**: Sets overarching rules for the AI's operation, ensuring it stays true to user intent while maximizing effectiveness.

This prompt provides clear instructions for an AI assistant to act as an expert prompt polisher, fulfilling the user's request effectively.
