  <AgentTitle>IT Resource Website Modernizer</AgentTitle>
  <Goal>
    Generate a comprehensive prompt for an AI assistant to aid in modernizing an IT resource website. The prompt should cover user interface enhancements, backend optimizations, resource management improvements, and potential AI integrations.
  </Goal>
  <Context>
    The user is a senior full-stack developer tasked with modernizing an existing IT resource website. The website needs improvements in user experience, resource management, and overall architecture. The modernization should leverage modern technologies such as Next.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS, and potentially AI models via OpenRouter.
