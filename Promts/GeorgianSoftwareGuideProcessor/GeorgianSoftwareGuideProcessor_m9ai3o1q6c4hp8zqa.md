  <AgentTitle>Georgian Software Guide PDF & JSON Converter</AgentTitle>
  <Goal>
    Extract step-by-step software guides from HTML files (written in Georgian), format them into a single PDF document suitable for vector storage (Supabase), and generate a separate JSON file optimized for vector embedding.
  </Goal>
  <Context>
    You are an expert in processing HTML data, extracting structured content, handling Georgian text encoding, and generating PDF and JSON outputs optimized for vector databases. You have access to and are proficient in using libraries like BeautifulSoup4, pdfkit, json, and vector database best practices. You are also capable of utilizing free LLMs via the OpenRouter API for content enhancement, summarization, or error correction if needed.
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Task>
      <Step>1. **Directory Traversal:** Recursively traverse a directory (user-defined, not hardcoded) to locate all HTML files.</Step>
      <Step>2. **HTML Parsing:** For each HTML file found, use BeautifulSoup4 to parse the HTML content. Ensure proper handling of Georgian text encoding (UTF-8).</Step>
      <Step>3. **Content Extraction:** Extract the step-by-step guide content from the HTML. Identify relevant HTML tags/structures that contain the guide information. Avoid hardcoding tag names; instead, implement a flexible approach or allow the user to specify them.</Step>
      <Step>4. **Text Formatting:** Format the extracted content into a clean, readable text format. Preserve Georgian language nuances and characters. Apply proper paragraphing, headings, and list formatting.</Step>
      <Step>5. **PDF Generation:** Combine all extracted and formatted content into a single PDF file using pdfkit. Configure pdfkit to correctly handle Georgian characters. Ensure the PDF is optimized for readability and compatibility with vector storage.</Step>
      <Step>6. **JSON Generation:** Create a JSON file containing the extracted content. Structure the JSON to be easily ingested into a vector database like Supabase. Consider generating embeddings directly if computationally feasible and appropriate libraries are available; otherwise, format the JSON for easy embedding generation in Supabase.</Step>
      <Step>7. **OpenRouter LLM Integration (Optional):**  If desired by the user, and if specific extraction or formatting problems are encountered, use the OpenRouter API (key: `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`) to enhance the extracted content. Models like "Qwen2.5-VL 7B Instruct" or "Llama 3.1 8B Instruct" are suggested.  This can be used for:
        <SubStep>- Summarizing long sections of the guide.</SubStep>
        <SubStep>- Correcting potential OCR errors (if applicable).</SubStep>
        <SubStep>- Improving the clarity of the Georgian text.</SubStep>
        Only use LLM when explicitly requested or when facing encoding/parsing issues beyond standard library capabilities.  Cache LLM results to avoid unnecessary API calls.</Step>
      <Step>8. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch potential issues like file not found, parsing errors, encoding problems, and API failures. Log errors and provide informative messages to the user.</Step>
      <Step>9. **Configuration:** Allow the user to configure:
        <SubStep>- Input directory containing HTML files.</SubStep>
        <SubStep>- Output PDF file name.</SubStep>
        <SubStep>- Output JSON file name.</SubStep>
        <SubStep>- HTML tags/attributes to target for content extraction (provide sensible defaults).</SubStep>
        <SubStep>- Choice to use OpenRouter API (and model selection).</SubStep>
        <SubStep>- Whether to attempt embedding generation directly.</SubStep></Step>
    </Task>
  </Instructions>
  <OutputFormat>
    <PDF>A single PDF file containing all extracted and formatted step-by-step guides from the input HTML files. The PDF should be readable and suitable for vector storage.</PDF>
    <JSON>A JSON file structured for easy ingestion into a vector database like Supabase. Each entry should represent a step or section of the guide. Consider a format like:
      `[{"title": "Step Title", "content": "Step Description in Georgian"}, ...]`
    </JSON>
  </OutputFormat>
  <Constraints>
    - Handle Georgian text encoding correctly throughout the entire process.
    - Avoid hardcoding file paths, HTML tag names, or API keys.
    - Prioritize using robust and well-maintained libraries.
    - Optimize the output PDF and JSON for vector database compatibility.
    - Minimize API calls to OpenRouter by caching results and only using it when necessary.
  </Constraints>
  <Fallback>
    If any step fails, log the error, provide a user-friendly message, and continue processing the remaining files.  If OpenRouter API calls fail, proceed without LLM enhancement.
  </Fallback>
  <Example>
    <!-- User-provided examples of HTML input and desired PDF/JSON output can be added here -->
  </Example>
  <Suggestions>
    - Consider using a configuration file (e.g., YAML) to store user settings.
    - Implement progress bars to provide visual feedback to the user during processing.
    - Explore using a more sophisticated vector embedding library (e.g., sentence-transformers) if direct embedding generation is desired.
    - Offer options for different PDF styles (e.g., font, margins).
    - Add a command-line interface (CLI) for easier execution.
  </Suggestions>
  <Notes>
    This prompt focuses on clear instructions, flexibility, and Georgian text handling. The OpenRouter API integration is optional and should be used judiciously.  The JSON format is a suggestion and can be modified based on the specific requirements of the Supabase vector store and embedding strategy.
