        <Output>
          &lt;Explanation&gt;Use getServerSideProps to fetch data on each request for SSR. This ensures that search engines can crawl the content and improves initial page load time.&lt;/Explanation&gt;
          &lt;CodeExample&gt;
            export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
              const data = await fetchData();
              return {
                props: { data },
              };
            }
            function MyPage({ data }) {
              return (&lt;div&gt;{data}&lt;/div&gt;);
            }
            export default MyPage;
          &lt;/CodeExample&gt;
          &lt;BestPractices&gt;Cache frequently accessed data to minimize database load.  Use a CDN for static assets.&lt;/BestPractices&gt;
          &lt;Alternatives&gt;Consider using Static Site Generation (SSG) with getStaticProps for content that doesn't change frequently.&lt;/Alternatives&gt;
