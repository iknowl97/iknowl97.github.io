I understand you want to "test with me." To make sure I can help you effectively, could you please tell me *what* you would like to test?

For example, are you interested in testing:

*   My ability to follow specific instructions?
*   My knowledge on a particular topic?
*   My creative writing skills?
*   My ability to generate code?

The more information you give me, the better I can understand your request and assist you in a way that is both helpful and appropriate.
