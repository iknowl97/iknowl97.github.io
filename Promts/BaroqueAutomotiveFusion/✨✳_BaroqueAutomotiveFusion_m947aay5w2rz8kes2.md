  <OriginalPrompt>
    Generate a hyperrealistic, Baroque-style image of a Lamborghini featuring a rug-patterned print, incorporating a "Creation of Adam"-inspired rooftop design showing a Nike-booted foot pressing the gas pedal. The overall aesthetic should emphasize Italian elegance and luxury.
  </OriginalPrompt>
  <Goal>
    To create a visually stunning, hyperrealistic image that seamlessly blends the luxury of a Lamborghini sports car, the artistic grandeur of the Baroque period, the iconic imagery of Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam," and a contemporary sportswear element (Nike). The final image should evoke a sense of opulent power and Italian elegance.
  </Goal>
  <Context>
    The user is seeking a unique and impactful visual that merges seemingly disparate elements into a cohesive and compelling artwork. The intent is to create a photorealistic image that captures the essence of luxury, artistic mastery, and modern style, appealing to audiences interested in automotive design, classical art, and contemporary fashion. Understanding of Baroque era key element is expected: ornate details, dramatic lighting, and rich color palettes. Familiarity with Lamborghini's design language is beneficial.
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Step>
      1. **Establish the Foundation:** Begin by creating a photorealistic 3D model of a Lamborghini sports car. The specific model (e.g., Aventador, Huracan) can be chosen based on aesthetic preference (Clarification Question: *Which Lamborghini model should be used?*). Pay meticulous attention to detail, accurately representing its sleek lines, aerodynamic features, and signature Italian design elements. Choose a camera angle that showcases the car's best features, considering dynamic perspectives (Clarification Question: *Is there a preferred camera angle or composition?*).
    </Step>
    <Step>
      2. **Rooftop Design - The "Creation of Adam" Reimagined:** Design the roof of the Lamborghini with a high-resolution rug pattern. (Clarification Question: *What type of rug pattern is preferred - Persian, Turkish, geometric, etc.? Provide examples if possible.*)  Integrate a motif inspired by Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam." Instead of the hands, feature a single, highly detailed Nike-booted foot pressing down on a gas pedal. The foot should be rendered with exceptional realism, showcasing the textures of the boot (Clarification Question: *Specify the Nike boot model or style to be used*). Ensure the rug pattern and the "Creation of Adam" element blend harmoniously, maintaining the overall Baroque aesthetic. Consider the rug material (e.g., silk, wool) and its effect on light and texture.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      3. **Baroque Infusion:** Incorporate Baroque-style elements throughout the image. This includes:
      *   **Subtle Ornamentation:** Add discreet Baroque-style ornamentation to the car's body â€“ perhaps along the edges, around the headlights, or on the side mirrors. Avoid overwhelming the car's original design (Clarification Question: *Are there any specific Baroque motifs or patterns you'd like to see incorporated?*).
      *   **Dramatic Lighting (Chiaroscuro):** Implement dramatic lighting with strong contrasts between light and shadow (chiaroscuro). Use multiple light sources to highlight specific features of the car and create a sense of depth and drama. The light should emphasize the curves and textures of the Lamborghini and the rug-patterned roof.
      *   **Baroque Background:** Create a background that suggests a Baroque palace interior or a lush Baroque landscape. This could include elements like ornate columns, elaborate draperies, or a meticulously manicured garden. The background should complement the car and enhance the overall sense of opulence.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      4. **Color Palette Mastery:** Establish a consistent color palette that is both luxurious and evocative of the Baroque period. Consider using a combination of:
      *   **Golds:** To represent wealth, grandeur, and divinity.
      *   **Deep Reds:** To convey passion, power, and royalty.
      *   **Rich Blues:** To suggest nobility, stability, and serenity.
      Ensure that the colors work harmoniously and create a visually pleasing composition.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      5. **Nike Branding Subtlety:** Ensure that the Nike branding on the boot is clearly visible enough to be recognizable but does not dominate the image or detract from the artistic style. The logo should be accurately rendered and integrated seamlessly into the overall design. Consider the angle and lighting to ensure the logo is visible without being overly prominent.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      6. **Reflections and Realism:** Pay meticulous attention to the lighting and reflections on the car's surface. Accurately simulate the way light interacts with the paint, chrome, and other materials. Use ray tracing or similar techniques to create realistic reflections and highlights that enhance the car's realism and visual impact. Consider environmental reflections (e.g., the Baroque background reflecting in the car's windows).
    </Step>
    <Step>
      7. **Material Specification:** Define the materials used for the car's interior (Clarification Question: *Specify preferred materials for the car's interior: e.g., leather, velvet, gold trim. Provide specific color choices*). Consider the texture and sheen of each material. Use high-resolution textures to create a realistic and luxurious interior.
    </Step>
