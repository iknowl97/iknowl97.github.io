  <Goal>Generate a hyperrealistic, Baroque-style image of a Lamborghini featuring a rug-patterned print, incorporating a "Creation of Adam"-inspired rooftop design showing a Nike-booted foot pressing the gas pedal. The overall aesthetic should emphasize Italian elegance and luxury.</Goal>
  <Context>
    The user envisions a striking visual that blends automotive design, classical art (specifically the Baroque period and "The Creation of Adam"), and contemporary sportswear (Nike). The image should be photorealistic and evoke a sense of opulence and power.
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Step1>
      Create a photorealistic rendering of a Lamborghini sports car, viewed from a third-person perspective, capturing its sleek lines and Italian design.
    </Step1>
    <Step2>
      Design the roof of the Lamborghini with a rug-patterned print that draws inspiration from Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam."  Replace the hands with a single, Nike-booted foot pressing down on a gas pedal. The foot should be highly detailed and convincingly integrated into the rug pattern. The rug design should blend seamlessly with the Baroque aesthetic.
    </Step2>
    <Step3>
      Incorporate Baroque-style elements throughout the image. This may include ornate details on the car's body (subtle, not overwhelming), dramatic lighting with strong contrasts (chiaroscuro), and a background that evokes a Baroque palace or landscape.
    </Step3>
    <Step4>
      Maintain a consistent color palette that is both luxurious and evocative of the Baroque period (e.g., golds, deep reds, and rich blues).
    </Step4>
    <Step5>
      Ensure the Nike branding on the boot is clearly visible but does not detract from the overall artistic style. It should be a subtle yet recognizable detail.
    </Step5>
    <Step6>
      Pay close attention to the lighting and reflections on the car's surface to enhance its realism and visual impact.
    </Step6>
