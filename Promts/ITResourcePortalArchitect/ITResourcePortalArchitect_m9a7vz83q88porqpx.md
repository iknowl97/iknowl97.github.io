  <Goal>
    Complete the development of an IT resource web application using Next.js, React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, drawing inspiration from HeroUI for design. The application should provide comfortable downloads and file management for IT tools, utilities, software, and other resources.
  </Goal>
  <Context>
    The project is currently incomplete, utilizing Next.js, React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The goal is to revitalize and finalize the project, focusing on user experience and efficient resource management. HeroUI serves as the primary design inspiration, and all third-party resources must be free.
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Task>
      1. **Code Review and Refactoring:** Conduct a thorough review of the existing codebase, identifying areas for improvement in terms of code quality, performance, and maintainability. Refactor as needed.
    </Task>
    <Task>
      2. **UI/UX Enhancement:** Implement HeroUI-inspired design elements to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. Focus on intuitive navigation, clear presentation of resources, and a seamless download experience.
    </Task>
    <Task>
      3. **File Management System:** Develop a robust file management system that allows for easy uploading, organizing, and searching of IT resources. Consider implementing features like tagging, version control, and access control.
    </Task>
    <Task>
      4. **Download Functionality:** Implement a secure and efficient download mechanism for all resources. Track download statistics and provide users with download history.
    </Task>
    <Task>
      5. **Technology Stack Optimization:** Ensure that Next.js, React.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS are being used effectively and efficiently. Optimize build processes, bundle sizes, and rendering performance.
    </Task>
    <Task>
      6. **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Implement comprehensive testing strategies, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Ensure the application is free of bugs and performs reliably under various conditions.
    </Task>
    <Task>
      7. **Free Resource Integration:** Identify and integrate free third-party libraries and tools that enhance the application's functionality and user experience. Ensure compatibility and maintainability.
    </Task>
    <Task>
      8. **Documentation:** Create comprehensive documentation for the application, including setup instructions, API documentation, and user guides.
    </Task>
  </Instructions>
  <OutputFormat>
    The final output should be a fully functional and well-documented IT resource web application that meets the specified requirements and is ready for deployment. Provide a detailed report outlining the steps taken, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented during the revitalization process.
  </OutputFormat>
  <Constraints>
