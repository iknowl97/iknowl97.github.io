  <Goal>
    Create a fully functional and modern web application designed for an IT team to manage and access essential resources, tools, and utilities. The application should prioritize ease of use, intuitive design, and efficient access to frequently needed resources. It should be ready for deployment with Docker.
  </Goal>
  <Context>
    The target users are IT professionals who need quick and reliable access to various tools, utilities, and documentation. The current website lacks modern design, efficient search/sorting capabilities, and lacks a user-friendly interface. The goal is to modernize the entire infrastructure, focusing on improved UX/UI, efficient resource management, and seamless deployment.
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Section title="Frontend Development">
      <Step>
        1. **Technology Stack:**
        - Use Next.js for the frontend framework to leverage server-side rendering and static site generation.
        - Implement Tailwind CSS for styling to ensure rapid UI development and maintainability.
        - Incorporate Heroicons (from Hero UI) for consistent and visually appealing icons.
        - Use React.js for component development and state management.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        2. **UX/UI Design:**
        - Design a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface, focusing on ease of navigation and quick access to resources.
        - Implement a prominent search bar with advanced filtering options to allow users to quickly find resources.
        - Create a dashboard that displays resource usage statistics and other relevant metrics.
        - Ensure the design is responsive and works seamlessly on various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
      </Step>
      <Step>
        3. **Resource Display:**
        - Display resources in a clear and organized manner, using card-based layouts or similar intuitive designs.
        - Provide detailed information for each resource, including descriptions, version numbers, and links to documentation.
        - Implement user-friendly sorting options (by name, date, popularity, etc.) and advanced filtering capabilities.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        4. **Download Functionality:**
        - Provide direct download links for each resource, allowing users to quickly download files to their downloads folder.
        - Implement a "+ Button" functionality to allow users to create custom download packages by combining multiple resources.
        - Integrate a download manager to track and manage downloads.
      </Step>
    </Section>
    <Section title="Backend Development">
      <Step>
        1. **Technology Stack:**
        - Use Next.js API routes for backend functionality.
        - Implement a robust data storage solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to manage resource metadata and statistics.
        - Use appropriate middleware for authentication and authorization.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        2. **Admin Panel:**
        - Develop a secure admin panel to manage resources, user roles, and website configurations.
        - Implement resource usage statistics tracking and display them in an easy-to-understand format.
        - Provide options to add, edit, and delete resources, as well as manage user accounts.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        3. **AI Integration (Optional):**
        - Integrate AI functionalities via OpenRouter using free models based on user needs (e.g., for documentation summarization or intelligent search).
        - Implement error logging and reporting using Sentry.
      </Step>
    </Section>
    <Section title="Dockerization and Deployment">
      <Step>
        1. **Docker Setup:**
        - Create `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files in the root directory.
        - Ensure the application is fully containerized for easy deployment and scalability.
        - Optimize Docker images for size and performance.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        2. **Deployment:**
        - Provide clear instructions for deploying the application using Docker Compose.
        - Consider using a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) for hosting.
      </Step>
    </Section>
    <Section title="Directory Structure">
      <Step>
        1. **Optimal Directory Structure:**
        - `/`: Root directory (contains `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `README.md`).
        - `/src`: Source code directory.
          - `/src/pages`: Next.js pages (frontend routes).
          - `/src/components`: Reusable React components.
          - `/src/styles`: Tailwind CSS configuration and global styles.
          - `/src/api`: Next.js API routes (backend).
          - `/src/lib`: Utility functions and helper modules.
          - `/src/models`: Data models (if using a database).
        - `/public`: Static assets (images, fonts, etc.).
      </Step>
    </Section>
    <Section title="Error Handling and Debugging">
      <Step>
        1. **Comprehensive Error Handling:**
        - Implement robust error handling throughout the application.
        - Provide informative error messages to users.
        - Use Sentry or similar tools for error tracking and reporting.
      </Step>
      <Step>
        2. **Debugging Tools:**
        - Integrate debugging tools to assist IT team in diagnosing and resolving issues quickly.
