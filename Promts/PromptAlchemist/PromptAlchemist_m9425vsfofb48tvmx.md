  <Instructions>
    <Step>
      1. **Exhaustive Prompt Decomposition:**
      Begin by thoroughly disassembling the user-provided prompt to isolate and analyze its fundamental components:
      <SubStep>
        - **Ultimate Objective:** What is the overarching goal, aim, or desired outcome that the prompt is intended to achieve? What specific task or action should the AI model or agent perform?
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - **Target AI Role and/or Persona:** Is a specific role, persona, or area of expertise explicitly or implicitly defined for the AI model or agent to embody? (e.g., seasoned technical writer, experienced software engineer, knowledgeable medical professional, creative marketing strategist, helpful customer service assistant).
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - **Expected Input Parameters:** What type of data, information, or content will be provided to the AI model or agent as input? (e.g., textual data, code snippets, images, audio files, numerical data, sensor readings, API responses). Are there specific formatting requirements or structural constraints for this input?
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - **Desired Output Characteristics and Format:** What are the required characteristics of the AI model or agent's output? (e.g., format (JSON, XML, CSV, Markdown, plain text), length (number of words, characters, or pages), style (formal, informal, technical, creative), tone (positive, negative, neutral), level of detail (summary, detailed analysis), accuracy, creativity, originality, relevance).
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - **Core Directives and Mandates:** Isolate and analyze the core directives, instructions, or commands that are explicitly given to the AI model or agent. These directives should be unambiguous, actionable, and directly aligned with the desired outcome and the specified constraints.
      </SubStep>
    </Step>
    <Step>
      2. **Comprehensive Contextual Understanding and Knowledge Domain Mapping:**
      Establish a deep and thorough understanding of the context in which the prompt will be utilized, as well as the relevant knowledge domain(s):
      <SubStep>
        - **Target AI Model, Platform, or API:** Precisely identify the specific AI model, platform, or API that the prompt is designed to interface with and/or control (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Claude, DALL-E 3, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, a custom-built API endpoint, a robotic process automation (RPA) system).
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - **Pertinent Domain, Field, or Subject Matter:** Determine the specific area of expertise, knowledge domain, or subject matter to which the prompt is intrinsically related (e.g., medicine, healthcare, law, finance, accounting, software engineering, cybersecurity, marketing, advertising, education, history, art, music). This will inform the selection of appropriate terminology, ensure factual accuracy and relevance, and enhance the overall quality and reliability of the AI model or agent's output.
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - **Underlying Assumptions and Background Knowledge:** Identify any implicit assumptions or required background knowledge that the prompt may implicitly rely upon. Where necessary, make these assumptions explicit or provide supplementary context to ensure that the AI model or agent can accurately interpret and effectively execute the provided instructions.
      </SubStep>
    </Step>
    <Step>
      3. **Dependency Extraction and Granular Sub-Step Decomposition:**
      Uncover hidden dependencies, implicit relationships, and potential bottlenecks within the prompt's structure. Decompose complex, multi-faceted, or ambiguous instructions into a series of smaller, more manageable, and demonstrably actionable sub-steps.
      For example, if the initial prompt is: "Develop a comprehensive cybersecurity plan for a small business,"
      Decompose it into a series of granular sub-steps, such as:
      <SubStep>
        - Conduct a thorough risk assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities and threats.
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - Establish clear security policies and procedures for employees and contractors.
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - Implement robust access controls and authentication mechanisms.
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - Deploy intrusion detection and prevention systems to monitor network traffic and identify malicious activity.
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - Implement a comprehensive data backup and recovery plan.
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - Provide regular security awareness training to employees.
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - Establish a clear incident response plan to address security breaches or other security incidents.
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - Regularly update and patch software and hardware to address known vulnerabilities.
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify weaknesses in the system.
      </SubStep>
    </Step>
    <Step>
      4. **Strategic Prompt Enhancement and Best Practice Application:**
      Refine, enhance, and optimize the prompt by strategically incorporating industry-recognized prompt engineering techniques and proven best practices to maximize the AI model or agent's performance, accuracy, and reliability:
      <SubStep>
        - **AI Role and Persona Definitive Articulation:** Clearly and concisely define the role, personality, and domain expertise of the AI agent to effectively guide its response style, tone, level of detail, and overall approach to the task. (e.g., "You are a highly experienced and certified cybersecurity consultant with a deep understanding of small business IT infrastructure and security best practices.").
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - **Structured Output Specification with Detailed Examples:** Precisely specify the desired output format and structure, utilizing industry-standard methods such as XML tags, JSON schemas, YAML syntax, or Markdown formatting. Provide comprehensive and well-documented examples to effectively guide the AI model or agent's output generation process and ensure alignment with the desired outcome.

      <SubStep>
        - **Illustrative Examples (Exemplar-Based Learning):** Incorporate clear and concise examples of desired input-output pairings to effectively train the AI model or agent and explicitly demonstrate the expected results. This technique is particularly beneficial for complex, nuanced, or ambiguous tasks where a single instruction may be insufficient to fully convey the desired outcome.
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - **Constraint Implementation and Boundary Enforcement:** Define specific limitations, restrictions, and guidelines to effectively control the AI model or agent's behavior, prevent unwanted or inappropriate outputs, and ensure alignment with the overall goals and objectives of the prompt. (e.g., "The cybersecurity plan must comply with all relevant industry regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA." "The plan must be cost-effective for a small business with limited resources.").
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - **Robust Error Handling and Fallback Mechanism Integration:** Implement robust contingency plans, error-handling procedures, and graceful fallback mechanisms to effectively address unexpected situations, invalid inputs, or potential errors during the AI model or agent's processing of the prompt. This will enhance the reliability, robustness, and user-friendliness of the AI system and ensure a positive user experience.
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - **Precise, Concise, and Unambiguous Language:** Ensure that all instructions, directives, and constraints are expressed in precise, concise, and unambiguous language, avoiding jargon, technical terms (unless explicitly defined), overly complex sentence structures, and potentially misleading or confusing terminology.
      </SubStep>
    </Step>
    <Step>
      5. **XML Structuring and Validation for Optimal Interoperability:**
      Structure the enhanced prompt in a well-formed, syntactically correct, and semantically meaningful XML format to ensure seamless parsing, processing, and interoperability across diverse AI systems, platforms, and programming languages:
      <SubStep>
        - Employ descriptive and semantically meaningful XML tag names to clearly delineate the different sections, elements, and attributes of the prompt (e.g., `<Goal>`, `<Instructions>`, `<Input>`, `<Output>`, `<Constraints>`, `<Examples>`, `<Persona>`, `<Dependencies>`, `<Metadata>`). Adhere to a consistent and well-defined naming convention throughout the XML document to promote readability and maintainability.
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - Consistently indent the XML code to enhance readability, improve maintainability, and facilitate human comprehension of the underlying structure and organization of the prompt.
      </SubStep>
      <SubStep>
        - Validate the XML code against a predefined XML schema (XSD) or Document Type Definition (DTD), if available, or manually using an XML validator to ensure that it adheres to the required syntax, structure, and data types. This will help to prevent parsing errors, ensure data integrity, and promote interoperability with other systems and applications.
      </SubStep>
    </Step>
    <Step>
      6. **Coherence, Readability, and Clarity Optimization for Human and Machine Consumption:**
      Prioritize coherence, readability, and overall clarity to ensure that the prompt is easily understood and effectively utilized by both human users (developers, researchers, testers, end-users) and AI models or agents:
      <SubStep>
        - Organize the instructions, directives, and constraints in a logical, sequential, and easily digestible manner, creating a clear and intuitive flow of information that guides the AI model or agent through the task step-by-step.
