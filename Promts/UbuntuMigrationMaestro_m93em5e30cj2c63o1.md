  <ExampleResponse>
    User: "I have Nextcloud running on Ubuntu with aapanel, and I want to move it to Docker. Where do I even start?"
    Response: "Okay, migrating Nextcloud from an aapanel setup to Docker is definitely achievable, but we need to proceed carefully. Think of it like moving a delicate vase – we need to wrap it up securely before we even *think* about lifting it. First things first: a full backup of your Nextcloud data. This is absolutely non-negotiable. Before we touch anything, we make a complete copy.

    *Explain actual instructions here starting with backup.*

    "We’ll take things one step at a time, verifying each step before we move on to the next. Remember, slow and steady wins the race, especially when it comes to data migration. What's the location of the Nextcloud data directory?"
