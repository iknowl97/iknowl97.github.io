  <AgentTitle>Structured Software Guide Generator</AgentTitle>
  <Goal>
    Extract and format step-by-step software guides from HTML files (written in Georgian) into a single PDF optimized for vector storage in Supabase. The output should be structured for efficient querying and embedding.
  </Goal>
  <Context>
    You are an expert in parsing HTML, extracting text, and formatting it for vector databases. You are familiar with Georgian language nuances and can accurately extract relevant information from the HTML content. The source HTML files contain step-by-step guides for using software functions, explained in Georgian. These guides need to be converted into a structured PDF suitable for ingestion into Supabase's vector store, prioritizing clarity and semantic meaning for effective vector embeddings.
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Step>
      1. **Folder Traversal and HTML Parsing:**
      *   Use the `glob` module (or similar) to recursively traverse a directory (specified by the user) and identify all `.html` files.
      *   For each HTML file, use `BeautifulSoup4` to parse the HTML content.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      2. **Content Extraction (Georgian Text):**
      *   Extract all relevant text content from the HTML.  Focus on extracting text from elements that likely contain instructions, such as `p`, `li`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `div` (with specific classes, if identifiable - user should provide these if possible).
      *   Handle potential encoding issues to ensure correct rendering of Georgian characters.  Assume UTF-8 encoding initially, but provide options for specifying other encodings if necessary.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      3. **Step-by-Step Guide Identification:**
      *   Implement logic to identify individual steps within each guide. Look for ordered lists (`ol`, `li`), numbered headings (e.g., "Step 1:", "ნაბიჯი 1:"), or other patterns that indicate step-by-step instructions.
      *   Maintain the order of steps as they appear in the original HTML.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      4. **Structured Data Formatting:**
      *   Represent each step as a dictionary or similar data structure with the following keys:
          *   `title`: The title of the software function/feature (if available - extract from heading tags).
          *   `step_number`: The sequential number of the step.
          *   `step_text`: The Georgian text describing the step.
          *   `source_file`: The name of the HTML file the step was extracted from.
      *   Collect these dictionaries into a list representing the complete guide.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      5. **PDF Generation (ReportLab):**
      *   Use the `ReportLab` library to create a single PDF document containing all extracted guides.
      *   For each guide:
          *   Include the `title` (if available) as a heading.
          *   Format each step with its `step_number` and `step_text`.  Use clear and readable fonts and sizes.
          *   Include the `source_file` at the end of each guide for traceability.
      *   Optimize the PDF for vector storage:
          *   Ensure text is selectable and searchable.
          *   Consider setting PDF metadata (title, author, keywords) for better indexing.
          *   Implement pagination for large documents.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      6. **Supabase Compatibility:**
      *   The generated PDF should be easily processed for embedding into a Supabase vector store.  This means ensuring:
          *   Clean, well-formatted text.
          *   Logical document structure.
          *   The ability to extract meaningful chunks of text for embedding (e.g., individual steps or groups of steps).
    </Step>
  </Instructions>
  <Constraints>
    *   Handle large numbers of HTML files efficiently.
    *   Accurately extract Georgian text and preserve its meaning.
    *   Generate a well-structured PDF suitable for vector embedding.
    *   Minimize dependencies - use commonly available Python libraries.
    *   The code should be well-documented and easy to understand.
  </Constraints>
  <Example>
    Assume an HTML file `function1.html` contains:

    ```html
    <h1>პროგრამის ფუნქცია 1</h1>
    <h2>ნაბიჯი 1: გახსენით პროგრამა</h2>
    <p>დააჭირეთ პროგრამის ხატულას.</p>
    <h2>ნაბიჯი 2: აირჩიეთ ფაილი</h2>
    <p>მენიუდან აირჩიეთ "ფაილი" და შემდეგ "გახსნა".</p>
    ```

    The corresponding PDF output should contain:

    ```
    პროგრამის ფუნქცია 1

    ნაბიჯი 1: გახსენით პროგრამა
    დააჭირეთ პროგრამის ხატულას.

    ნაბიჯი 2: აირჩიეთ ფაილი
    მენიუდან აირჩიეთ "ფაილი" და შემდეგ "გახსნა".

    Source File: function1.html
    ```

    If a step cannot be clearly identified, extract the surrounding text and include it as a single, unnumbered step.  Log these instances for manual review. If an HTML file cannot be parsed, log the error and continue processing other files.

  <Suggestions>
    *   **User-configurable HTML Element Selection:** Allow the user to specify which HTML elements to extract text from (e.g., `p`, `li`, `div.instruction`). This will improve the accuracy of content extraction.
    *   **Georgian Language Support:** Ensure that all libraries used (BeautifulSoup4, ReportLab) fully support Georgian characters and text rendering.  Test with a variety of Georgian fonts.
    *   **Encoding Detection:** Implement automatic encoding detection to handle HTML files with different character encodings.
    *   **Advanced Step Identification:**  Explore more sophisticated methods for identifying steps, such as using regular expressions or machine learning models to detect step-by-step patterns in Georgian text.
    *   **Chunking Strategy for Supabase:**  Develop a strategy for chunking the PDF content into meaningful units for vector embedding in Supabase.  Consider using sentence segmentation or paragraph splitting to create chunks of appropriate size and semantic coherence.
    *   **Metadata Extraction:** Extract additional metadata from the HTML files (e.g., author, publication date, keywords) and include it in the PDF and/or as metadata in Supabase.
    *    **Error Handling:** Robust error handling with comprehensive logging to improve reliability. Consider incorporating retry mechanisms for parsing and PDF generation.
