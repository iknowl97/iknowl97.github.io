  <Goal>Analyze the entirety of the provided conversation history to identify the user's overarching goals, specific requirements, and desired functionalities, and then generate a single, comprehensive prompt that encapsulates all identified elements to guide an AI system towards fulfilling the user's needs.</Goal>
  <Context>
    This prompt serves to analyze a conversation history between a user and an AI assistant, focusing specifically on distilling the user's cumulative goals, explicit instructions, and any implicitly understood requirements into a unified, actionable prompt. This prompt aims to capture the user's *complete* intention as expressed throughout the interaction, rather than focusing on individual requests.

    The target use case, derived from the conversation history, is the creation of a Dockerized RDP health monitoring system, including multiple check methods, database logging, and a simple dashboard, automated via a `setup.sh` script. The final, generated prompt should therefore guide the AI towards producing a solution that comprehensively addresses *all* aspects of this system, as revealed in the conversation.
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Section name="Conversation Analysis">
      1.  Carefully analyze the entire conversation history, identifying:
          *   The user's core goal (e.g., creating a Dockerized RDP health monitoring system).
          *   Specific requirements and instructions (e.g., multiple check methods, database logging, dashboard, `setup.sh` script).
          *   Desired output formats (e.g., clear text summary, well-structured prompts, executable `setup.sh` script).
          *   Constraints (e.g., no hallucination, focus on clarification, specific formatting).
          *   Examples (if any are explicitly provided in the conversation).
      2.  Pay close attention to any modifications, clarifications, or refinements made by the user throughout the conversation.
      3.  Identify any implicit assumptions or understandings that are evident in the conversation.
    </Section>

    <Section name="Prompt Generation">
      1.  Based on the comprehensive analysis, generate a single, unified prompt that encapsulates all identified elements.
      2.  The generated prompt should be clear, concise, and actionable.
      3.  The prompt should specify:
          *   The AI agent's role (e.g., Docker and Linux specialist, prompt enhancer, summarizer).
          *   The overarching goal (e.g., create a Dockerized RDP health monitoring system).
          *   Specific tasks and instructions (e.g., implement multiple check methods, log results to a database, create a simple dashboard, generate a `setup.sh` script).
          *   Desired output formats (e.g., clear text summary, well-structured prompts, executable `setup.sh` script).
          *   Constraints (e.g., no hallucination, focus on clarification, specific formatting).
          *   Any relevant examples or contextual information.
      4.  The prompt should be designed to guide the AI towards producing a complete and cohesive solution that addresses all of the user's needs as expressed throughout the conversation.
      5.  The prompt should prioritize aspects of automation, ease of use and robust error handling.
    </Section>

    <Section name="Output Format">
      1.  The output should be a single, well-formatted prompt in XML format, following the standard structure used throughout the conversation.
      2.  The prompt should be self-contained and require no additional context.
    </Section>
  </Instructions>
  <Example>
    This task does not lend itself to a single, simple example. The entire conversation history serves as the input for generating the final prompt.
  </Example>
  <Constraints>
    - The generated prompt should accurately reflect all aspects of the user's needs as expressed throughout the entire conversation.
    - The generated prompt should be clear, concise, and actionable.
    - The generated prompt should be well-formatted and easy to understand.
  </Constraints>
  <Fallback>
    If the conversation history is incomplete or ambiguous, the generated prompt should indicate any areas where further clarification is needed.
  </Fallback>
</Prompt>

To use this, you would provide the *entire chat history* as context to the agent using this prompt. The output should be a single XML prompt designed to perform the overall task described in the conversation. Because I don't have access to the chat history outside this turn, I can't provide that prompt directly.
