    Generate a hyperrealistic image of a Lamborghini incorporating rug pattern prints and Baroque artistic elements, with a focus on Italian design sensibilities.
  </OriginalPrompt>
  <Goal>
    To generate a hyperrealistic and visually stunning image of a Lamborghini, seamlessly blending intricate rug patterns, opulent Baroque artistic elements, and sophisticated Italian design principles. The image should evoke a sense of luxurious craftsmanship, high-performance, and artistic grandeur, subtly inspired by Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam," and featuring a unique detail of Nike-branded boots pressing the gas pedal.
  </Goal>
  <Context>
    You are a master digital artist specializing in photorealistic renderings and the fusion of diverse artistic styles. The user seeks a unique and compelling image that harmonizes automotive design with classical art and textile patterns. Your expertise will bring this vision to life, capturing a sense of luxury, Italian craftsmanship, and artistic grandeur. You have deep knowledge of Lamborghini design, Baroque art, rug patterns, and hyperrealism techniques.
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Step>
      1. **Establish the Base Lamborghini Model:** Choose a specific Lamborghini model (e.g., Aventador, Huracan, Urus). If the user hasn't specified a preference, use the Aventador as the default. Clearly define the car's exterior color scheme. Default to a deep, rich crimson with gold accents if unspecified.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      2. **Rug Pattern Integration:** Select and apply intricate rug patterns to specific car elements. Focus on the interior – seats (consider using different patterns for the seat and back), dashboard, steering wheel, and door panels. Subtly incorporate rug patterns on exterior elements like the side mirrors or a thin racing stripe. Ensure the patterns seamlessly integrate with the car's form, respecting the curvature and contours of the surfaces. For the rug pattern, default to a Persian-style rug with deep reds, blues, and gold if the user provides no specifications.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      3. **Italian Design Sensibilities:** Emphasize the inherent Italian design aesthetics of the Lamborghini. Maintain its sleek lines, aggressive stance, and aerodynamic profile. Ensure all modifications and additions complement the existing design language, enhancing its visual appeal rather than detracting from it.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      4. **Baroque Art Integration:** Infuse Baroque style elements into the overall composition. This includes ornate detailing around the headlights and taillights, subtle gold leaf accents on the body panels, and a sense of dramatic lighting with strong contrasts between light and shadow. Consider adding sculpted Baroque ornamentation to the interior – small cherub-like figures subtly integrated into the dashboard design.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      5. **"The Creation of Adam" Inspiration:** Subtly evoke the artistic style and composition of Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam." The lighting should be reminiscent of the fresco, with a divine glow highlighting the car's key features. The overall composition should create a sense of awe and grandeur, mirroring the Renaissance masterpiece. The composition should emphasize the powerful and dynamic connection between the car and the driver.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      6. **Nike-Branded Feet Detail:** Include a close-up detail of a pair of Nike-branded feet wearing vintage-style racing boots pressing the gas pedal. Ensure the feet are positioned to accentuate the car's power and performance. Style the interior surrounding the pedals in a distinctly Baroque manner – perhaps with gilded trim or velvet upholstery. Show wear and tear on the boots to enhance realism.
    </Step>
    <Step>
      7. **Lighting and Rendering:** Utilize advanced lighting techniques to create a hyperrealistic rendering. Pay close attention to reflections, shadows, and highlights to enhance the depth and realism of the image. Ensure all materials (leather, metal, rug patterns) are rendered with accurate textures and surface properties.
    </Step>
    <Step>
       8. **Environment:** Create a suitable background for the Lamborghini. Consider a grand Italian villa courtyard with Baroque architecture, or a dimly lit garage adorned with Renaissance paintings and statues. The environment should enhance the overall sense of luxury and artistic grandeur.
    </Step>

        Lamborghini Aventador, Persian rug pattern, Gold Baroque accents.
      </Input>
      <Output>
        A hyperrealistic image of a crimson Lamborghini Aventador featuring Persian rug patterns on the seats and dashboard, styled with gold Baroque ornamentation.

  </Examples>
  <Constraints>
    <Constraint>
      The image must be photorealistic, high-resolution (minimum 4000x3000 pixels), and suitable for large-format printing.
    </Constraint>
    <Constraint>
      The rug patterns must be seamlessly and realistically integrated into the car's design, avoiding any jarring or unrealistic transitions.
    </Constraint>
    <Constraint>
      The Baroque elements should enhance the overall composition without overwhelming the car's fundamental design, maintaining a balance between opulence and subtlety.
    </Constraint>
    <Constraint>
      The "Creation of Adam" inspiration should be evident in the artistic style and composition (lighting, overall feel) but should not be a direct imitation.
    </Constraint>
    <Constraint>
        The Nike brand should be clearly identifiable but not the main focus of the image. Avoid explicit logos and focus on the general shape and design of Nike footwear.
    </Constraint>
  </Constraints>
  <OutputFormat>
    A high-resolution (4000x3000 pixels or higher) JPEG or PNG image file, rendered in photorealistic style, showcasing the Lamborghini with all specified elements seamlessly integrated.
  </OutputFormat>

  <UnderlyingDependencies>
    The success of the image relies on a deep understanding of automotive design, Baroque art, textile patterns, lighting techniques, and hyperrealistic rendering. The integration of these elements must be seamless and harmonious to create a visually compelling and believable image. The choice of rug patterns, color schemes, and Baroque ornamentation will significantly impact the overall aesthetic.
