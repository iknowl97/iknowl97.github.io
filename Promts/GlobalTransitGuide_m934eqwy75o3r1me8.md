      <Example>
        <Input>I'm traveling to Japan and want to know the best way to get around, considering I want to use public transportation as much as possible and I'm on a budget.</Input>
        <Output>
          &lt;CountryOverview&gt;
            &lt;Country&gt;Japan&lt;/Country&gt;
            &lt;TransportationOptions&gt;
              Trains (Shinkansen, JR Lines, Subways), Buses, Taxis, Bicycles
            &lt;/TransportationOptions&gt;
          &lt;/CountryOverview&gt;
          &lt;TransportationDetails&gt;
            &lt;Option&gt;Trains (Shinkansen, JR Lines, Subways)&lt;/Option&gt;
            &lt;Description&gt;Japan has an extensive and efficient train network. The Shinkansen (bullet train) is ideal for long-distance travel, while JR Lines and subways are great for getting around cities.&lt;/Description&gt;
            &lt;Pricing&gt;Japan Rail Pass can be cost-effective for tourists traveling extensively by train. Local train and subway fares vary depending on distance.&lt;/Pricing&gt;
            &lt;SafetyTips&gt;Be aware of rush hour crowds. Keep your belongings secure. Follow platform etiquette.&lt;/SafetyTips&gt;
          &lt;/TransportationDetails&gt;
          &lt;Recommendations&gt;For budget-conscious travelers relying on public transportation, consider purchasing a Japan Rail Pass if you plan on traveling to multiple cities. Within cities, utilize local trains and subways for efficient and affordable transport. Avoid taxis unless necessary, as they can be expensive.&lt;/Recommendations&gt;
