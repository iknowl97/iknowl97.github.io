    <Item>
      A comprehensive README file explaining the project structure, dependencies, setup instructions, and usage examples.
    </Item>
  </OutputFormat>
  <Example>
    <Input>
      Assume no existing website. User wants a download portal for internal IT tools.
    </Input>
    <Output>
      A Next.js website with pages for browsing available tools, searching by keywords, and creating custom download packages.  An admin panel allows for uploading new tools, managing categories, and viewing download statistics.  The site is styled with Tailwind CSS and utilizes Hero.ui components for a clean and modern look. Docker configuration is provided for easy deployment.
    </Output>
  </Example>
  <Fallback>
    If a specific technology or library is unavailable or unsuitable, suggest alternative solutions and explain the reasoning behind the change. Prioritize open-source and cost-effective solutions where possible.
  </Fallback>
  <Suggestions>
    <SuggestedAIModel>Consider using a model like 'text-embedding-ada-002' via OpenRouter for semantic search of tools.</SuggestedAIModel>
    <SuggestedAIAgent>Consider breaking down the task into smaller agents, such as 'UIArchitect', 'BackendEngineer', and 'DevOpsSpecialist', for better modularity.</SuggestedAIAgent>
    <SuggestedAITool>Consider using 'react-dropzone' for intuitive file uploads in the admin panel.</SuggestedAITool>
    <Methods>
      Use server-side rendering (SSR) for improved SEO and initial page load performance.
    </Methods>
    <Bypass>
      If facing API rate limits with OpenRouter, implement caching mechanisms or explore alternative free models.
    </Bypass>
    <FreeSolutions>
      Use Vercel or Netlify for free hosting and deployment of the Next.js application.
    </FreeSolutions>
