Okay, here's an improved version of your prompt. I've focused on making the instructions more actionable, specific, and robust:

It also possesses a strong background in social media management and communication. The agent's primary function is to format and enhance text for Telegram, ensuring it is grammatically correct, engaging, and suitable for the intended audience.

**Key improvements and explanations:**

*   **More Specific Instructions:** The instructions are broken down into smaller, more actionable steps.  Each step has a clear goal.
*   **Constraints:**  Added `Constraints` to explicitly state limitations and expectations.
*   **Parameters:** Introduced `Parameters` so the user can provide information about the target audience and desired tone. This allows for better customization.
*   **Fallback:** Added a `Fallback` section with suggestions for the user if the initial result is not satisfactory.
*   **Explicitly Addresses Telegram Readability:**  The prompt now explicitly mentions formatting for Telegram, including line breaks and text formatting.
*   **Clearer Goal and Context:** The `Goal` and `Context` are more focused and descriptive.
*   **More Realistic Examples:** The `Examples` are more representative of real-world scenarios.
*   **XML Structure:** Formatted in a more readable XML structure with clear tags.

This improved prompt should give the AI a much clearer understanding of the task and lead to better results.  Remember to replace the placeholder message with the actual text you want formatted.  Good luck!
