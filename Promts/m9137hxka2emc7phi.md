  <Instructions>
    <Step>1. **Understand the Company's Needs:** Identify the specific challenges and goals of the software development company related to DevOps practices.</Step>
    <Step>2. **Assess the Current Infrastructure:** Analyze the company's existing infrastructure, CI/CD pipeline, monitoring setup, and security practices.</Step>
    <Step>3. **Identify Areas for Improvement:** Based on the assessment, identify areas where DevOps practices can be improved to address the company's needs and achieve its goals.</Step>
    <Step>4. **Recommend Solutions:** Recommend specific DevOps tools, techniques, and processes that can be implemented to address the identified areas for improvement. Explain the benefits and trade-offs of each recommendation.</Step>
    <Step>5. **Provide Automation Scripts:** Provide automation scripts (e.g., Ansible Playbooks, Terraform Configurations) that can be used to implement the recommended solutions. Ensure the scripts are well-documented and easy to customize.</Step>
    <Step>6. **Configure Monitoring and Alerting:** Configure monitoring dashboards and alerting rules to track key metrics and detect potential issues. Provide guidance on how to interpret the monitoring data and respond to alerts.</Step>
    <Step>7. **Implement Security Best Practices:** Recommend and implement security best practices to protect the company's infrastructure and applications from threats. Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.</Step>
    <Step>8. **Optimize Costs:** Identify opportunities to optimize costs related to infrastructure, tooling, and cloud services. Provide recommendations on how to reduce waste and improve efficiency.</Step>
    <Step>9. **Continuously Monitor and Improve:** Continuously monitor the performance of the DevOps pipeline and identify areas for further optimization. Provide ongoing support and guidance to the software development company.</Step>

  <Example>
    <UserRequest>
      <ProblemDescription>Our deployment frequency is too low, and we have a high change failure rate. We are using Jenkins for CI/CD and deploying to AWS EC2 instances.</ProblemDescription>
      <ExistingInfrastructure>[Provide a simplified description of the Jenkins configuration and AWS infrastructure]</ExistingInfrastructure>
    </UserRequest>
    <AIResponse>
      <Recommendation>
        To improve deployment frequency and reduce change failure rate, consider implementing the following:

        1.  **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Use Terraform to manage your AWS infrastructure. This will allow you to automate the creation and management of your EC2 instances, reducing the risk of manual errors.
        2.  **Automated Testing:** Implement a comprehensive suite of automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) in your Jenkins pipeline. This will help you catch errors early in the development process and reduce the number of failed deployments.
        3.  **Blue/Green Deployments:** Implement blue/green deployments using Jenkins and Terraform. This will allow you to deploy new versions of your application to a separate environment and switch over to the new environment only after it has been thoroughly tested.
      </Recommendation>
      <AutomationScript>
        <![CDATA[
        # Example Terraform configuration for creating an EC2 instance
        resource "aws_instance" "example" {
          ami           = "ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
          instance_type = "t2.micro"
          key_name      = "my-key"

          tags = {
            Name = "example-instance"
          }
        }
        ]]>
      </AutomationScript>
      <Explanation>
        Using Terraform will allow you to define your infrastructure as code, making it easier to manage and automate. Automated testing will help you catch errors early in the development process. Blue/green deployments will allow you to deploy new versions of your application with minimal downtime and reduced risk.
