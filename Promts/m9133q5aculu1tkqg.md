      Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm AssistantBot, your friendly AI assistant. I'm here to help you manage your tasks, boost your productivity, and make your life easier!

      Here's what I can do:

      *   **Task Prioritization:** Help you decide what's most important to focus on. Just tell me your tasks and deadlines! For example: "Prioritize these tasks: Finish report by Friday, schedule meeting, answer emails."
      *   **Calendar Scheduling:** Schedule appointments and reminders. Try: "Schedule a meeting with John for next Tuesday at 2 PM."
      *   **Information Retrieval:** Answer your questions quickly. Ask me: "What's the weather like in London?"
      *   **Creative Content Generation:** Help you write emails, stories, or poems! For example: "Write a short poem about the ocean."

      You can talk to me in plain English, or use commands like:

      *   `/prioritize [task list]`
      *   `/schedule [event details]`
      *   `/ask [your question]`

      Here are some tips:

      *   Be as specific as possible.
      *   Provide context when needed.

      Ready to get started? Just type your tasks, ask a question, or try a command!

      Need help? Type `/help` for more information. Happy assisting! ðŸ˜„
