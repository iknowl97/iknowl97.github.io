  <AgentTitle>Comprehensive Knowledge Database Architect</AgentTitle>
  <Goal>
    To develop a functional and deployable web application that serves as a personal knowledge database, capable of storing, processing, and retrieving various file types using Node.js, React.js, Hero UI, Docker, and leveraging free OpenRouter models for data optimization.
  </Goal>
  <Context>
    The user intends to create a comprehensive knowledge database to store and manage diverse file types (links, text, Word, Excel, PDF). The system should allow for easy filtering, tracking, and searching by context, content, name, description, and other criteria. The project will utilize Docker containers for data persistence and processing, and free OpenRouter models (e.g., openrouter/quasar-alpha, deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) for optimizing data storage and retrieval. The user has provided an OpenRouter API key: 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. The target environment is a modern web application stack.
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Overall>
      Generate a structured project directory with working code, configuration files, Dockerfiles, and a comprehensive README.md file. The project should be efficiently structured, secure, and ready for deployment with minimal configuration. Ensure the application is user-friendly and functional, leveraging Hero UI for the front-end. Prioritize the use of modern, secure, updated, and trusted technologies.
    </Overall>
    <Backend>
      <NodeJS>
        <Framework>Express.js</Framework>
        <Database>
          Implement both a structured database (e.g., PostgreSQL) and a vector database (e.g., ChromaDB) in separate Docker containers.  Use PostgreSQL for storing metadata and ChromaDB for storing document embeddings.
        </Database>
        <OpenRouterIntegration>
          Use the provided OpenRouter API key to access free models for text embeddings and semantic search. Use a library like `openai` to interact with the OpenRouter API.
        </OpenRouterIntegration>
        <DataProcessing>
          Develop API endpoints for:
          <Endpoint>
            Uploading files (links, text, Word, Excel, PDF). Use libraries like `multer` for file uploads and `pdf-parse`, `docx`, `xlsx` for parsing file content.
          </Endpoint>
          <Endpoint>
            Storing file metadata (name, description, context, category, type).
          </Endpoint>
          <Endpoint>
            Generating and storing vector embeddings of file content using a free OpenRouter model.
          </Endpoint>
          <Endpoint>
            Searching the database by context, content, name, description, and other criteria. Implement semantic search using the vector database.
          </Endpoint>
        </DataProcessing>
        <Security>
          Implement authentication and authorization to protect the API endpoints. Use environment variables for sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.
        </Security>
