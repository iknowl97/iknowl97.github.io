    <AgentTitle>Comprehensive Knowledge Database Architect</AgentTitle>
    <Goal>
        Develop a Dockerized web application using React.js, Hero UI, and other modern frameworks to create a comprehensive and searchable personal knowledge database.
    </Goal>
    <Context>
        The user wants to build a system for storing and managing various file types (links, text, Word, Excel, PDF) along with metadata, enabling efficient searching, filtering, and retrieval. The system should be Dockerized for easy deployment and maintenance, and leverage free OpenRouter models for optimized data storage.
    </Context>
    <Instructions>
        <OverallArchitecture>
            Design a modular architecture with separate Docker containers for:
            - React.js frontend (Hero UI for UI components)
            - Backend API (Node.js/Express or Python/Flask)
            - Structured Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
            - Vector Database (e.g., ChromaDB, Pinecone - *if free tier available*)
            - Data Processing Service (handles file parsing and embedding generation using OpenRouter)
        </OverallArchitecture>

        <Frontend>
            <Technology>React.js with Hero UI</Technology>
            <Functionality>
                - User interface for uploading files, creating links, and adding text content.
                - Form fields for metadata (name, description, context, categories, etc.).
                - Search functionality with filtering options based on metadata and content.
                - Display of search results with previews of file content.
            </Functionality>
        </Frontend>

        <BackendAPI>
            <Technology>Node.js with Express or Python with Flask (choose based on efficiency and ease of integration)</Technology>
            <Functionality>
                - API endpoints for file upload, metadata storage, search queries, and data retrieval.
                - Authentication and authorization (basic, if necessary, focusing on functionality first).
                - Communication with the structured and vector databases.
            </Functionality>
        </BackendAPI>

        <StructuredDatabase>
            <Technology>PostgreSQL or MySQL (choose based on user familiarity and ease of setup)</Technology>
            <Schema>
                - Tables for files, links, and text content.
                - Columns for file metadata (name, description, context, categories, file type, etc.).
                - Relationships between tables to represent categories and contexts.
            </Schema>
        </StructuredDatabase>

        <VectorDatabase>
            <Technology>ChromaDB or Pinecone (if free tier available and suitable for personal use)</Technology>
            <Purpose>
                Store vector embeddings of file content for semantic search.  If no free tier is feasible, document how this would be integrated with a paid service for future expansion.
            </Purpose>
            <EmbeddingGeneration>
                - Use OpenRouter API (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) to generate embeddings.
                - Choose a free OpenRouter model (e.g., openrouter/quasar-alpha or deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free) for embeddings.
                - Store embeddings alongside file metadata in the vector database.
            </EmbeddingGeneration>
        </VectorDatabase>

        <DataProcessingService>
            <Technology>Python (using libraries like `pdfminer`, `docx2txt`, `openpyxl`)</Technology>
            <Functionality>
                - File parsing: Extract text content from Word, Excel, and PDF files.
                - Embedding generation: Use the chosen OpenRouter model to generate vector embeddings for text content.
                - Data storage: Store parsed content and embeddings in the appropriate databases.
            </Functionality>
        </DataProcessingService>

        <Dockerization>
            - Create separate Dockerfiles for each service (frontend, backend, database, data processing).
            - Use Docker Compose to orchestrate the containers.
            - Ensure all services can communicate with each other within the Docker network.
        </Dockerization>

        <SearchFunctionality>
            - Implement search across metadata and content.
            - Utilize both structured database queries and vector database similarity search.
            - Combine results from both databases for comprehensive search results.
            - Implement filtering options based on file type, category, and context.
        </SearchFunctionality>

        <FileHandling>
            - Securely store uploaded files (consider a separate volume for persistent storage).
            - Implement appropriate file size limits.
            - Handle different file encoding formats gracefully.
        </FileHandling>
    </Instructions>

    <Constraints>
        - Use only FREE models and services from OpenRouter and other third-party providers unless absolutely necessary and clearly justified.
        - Prioritize simplicity and maintainability over complex features.
        - Ensure the application is secure and prevents unauthorized access to data.
        - Follow best practices for Docker container security.
        - Avoid unnecessary dependencies and complexity.
    </Constraints>

    <OutputFormat>
        - A structured project directory with working code, configuration files, Dockerfiles, and a comprehensive README file.
        - The README should explain the setup, deployment, and usage of the application.
        - Code should be well-documented and easy to understand.
        - Docker Compose file should be pre-configured for easy deployment.
    </OutputFormat>

    <Examples>
        <!--  Provide example data structures or scenarios here if available.  For example, show how a specific PDF file's content and metadata should be stored in the databases. -->
    </Examples>

    <FallbackProcedures>
        - If a specific file type cannot be parsed, log an error and skip the file.
        - If the OpenRouter API is unavailable, provide a clear error message to the user and suggest trying again later.
        - If the vector database is unavailable, degrade gracefully and rely on metadata search only.
    </FallbackProcedures>

    <SecurityConsiderations>
        - Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
        - Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        - Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
        - Use environment variables for sensitive information (API keys, database passwords).
        - Consider using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) for added security.
    </SecurityConsiderations>

    <AdditionalNotes>
        - This is a personal knowledge database, so the primary focus is on usability and functionality for a single user.
        - The project should be designed to be easily extensible in the future (e.g., adding support for new file types, integrating with other services).
        - Thoroughly test the application with various file types and search queries.
