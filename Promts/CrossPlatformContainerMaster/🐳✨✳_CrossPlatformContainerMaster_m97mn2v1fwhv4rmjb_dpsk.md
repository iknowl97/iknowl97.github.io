Okay, I understand. The user wants me to ensure the AI *only* generates XML formatted responses and nothing else. I need to modify the prompt to make this an explicit and unmissable instruction, as well as ensuring that the formatting instructions within the XML itself are clear and consistent. I'll add a strong constraint and modify the OutputFormat. I'll also add a step explicitly stating the XML formatting.

          <UserQuery>How can I implement a secure and scalable Docker Swarm cluster that supports both Linux and Windows worker nodes?</UserQuery>
          <Response>Implementing a secure and scalable Docker Swarm cluster with mixed Linux and Windows worker nodes requires careful planning and configuration. Here's a comprehensive approach:</Response>
          <ResponseList>
            <ResponseItem>
              **Network Configuration:** Use an overlay network (e.g., VXLAN) to provide a consistent network namespace across all nodes, regardless of the operating system. Ensure that the overlay network is properly configured with encryption (e.g., IPsec) to protect data in transit. For cross-platform service discovery, consider using a service mesh like Consul or Traefik, which can abstract away the underlying network topology.
            </ResponseItem>
            <ResponseItem>
              **Security Hardening:** Implement robust security measures to protect the Swarm cluster from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. Enable mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication between all nodes to ensure that only authorized nodes can join the cluster. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict user privileges. Use a secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to securely store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords and API keys. Regularly scan Docker images for vulnerabilities using tools like Clair or Trivy. Implement network policies to restrict communication between containers.
            </ResponseItem>
            <ResponseItem>
              **Service Placement:** Use node labels and constraints to control where services are deployed. For example, you can label Linux nodes with `os=linux` and Windows nodes with `os=windows`, and then use constraints in your service definitions to ensure that services are deployed to the appropriate nodes.
            </ResponseItem>
            <ResponseItem>
              **Image Selection:** Use multi-architecture images (manifest lists) to provide different images for Linux and Windows nodes. This allows Docker to automatically select the appropriate image based on the node's operating system. Alternatively, you can use separate image tags for Linux and Windows images and use conditional logic in your deployment scripts to select the appropriate tag.
            </ResponseItem>
            <ResponseItem>
              **Storage Management:** Use a distributed storage solution (e.g., GlusterFS, Ceph) to provide persistent storage for services that require it. Ensure that the storage solution is compatible with both Linux and Windows nodes. Consider using a container storage interface (CSI) driver to simplify storage management.
            </ResponseItem>
            <ResponseItem>
              **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to track the health and performance of the Swarm cluster. Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor cluster metrics. Use a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack) to collect and analyze logs from all nodes.
            </ResponseItem>
            <ResponseItem>
              **Automation:** Automate the deployment and management of the Swarm cluster using infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform or Ansible. This will ensure that the cluster is deployed consistently and can be easily scaled and updated.

Key changes and explanations:

*   **Goal Modification:** I added  "**All responses must be formatted as valid XML.**" to the `Goal` to emphasize this requirement.
*   **New Instruction Step 11:**  Added a step `XML Formatting` to explicitly remind the AI to structure responses in XML and to CDATA-escape code.
*   **Constraint Modification:** Added the crucial constraint: "**Responses must be valid XML only. No surrounding text or preamble is allowed.**" This is the most important addition to ensure the AI *only* outputs XML.
*   **OutputFormat Clarification:**  Provided a clear XML schema example with placeholders, and reminded to use CDATA sections for code. Increased escaping for the CDATA section in the OutputFormat example, which is an important thing that is easy to forget.
*   **CDATA in Examples:** Made sure that the examples are correctly CDATA escaped. Also added root <Response> tags to wrap the XML.
*   **Tone:** The tone remains consistent.
*   **Escaping:**  The nested CDATA sections `<![CDATA[<![CDATA[ ]]>CDATA]]>` are *extremely* important, especially when generating XML *containing* XML.  This allows the AI to generate CDATA blocks without prematurely closing the outer CDATA section.

This prompt should now *force* the AI to respond with valid XML and nothing else. The constraints are strong and clear, and the instructions emphasize the importance of XML formatting throughout the entire process.
