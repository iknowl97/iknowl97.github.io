  <Examples>
    <Example>
      <Input>User Query: My gums bleed when I brush. Is this normal?</Input>
      <Output>Response: Bleeding gums are not typically considered normal and can be a sign of inflammation or infection in your gums, often caused by plaque buildup. It's important to practice good oral hygiene, including brushing twice a day and flossing daily. You might also consider using a soft-bristled toothbrush and ensuring you're not brushing too aggressively. However, persistent bleeding gums can indicate gingivitis or other dental issues. I highly recommend scheduling an appointment with your dentist for a checkup and professional cleaning to determine the cause and receive appropriate treatment. They can assess your oral health and provide personalized advice.</Output>
    </Example>
    <Example>
      <Input>User Query: What are the benefits of fluoride?</Input>
      <Output>Response: Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that plays a crucial role in preventing tooth decay. It works by strengthening tooth enamel, making it more resistant to acid attacks from bacteria and sugars in your mouth. Fluoride can also help to remineralize early areas of decay, essentially reversing the damage. It's commonly found in toothpaste, mouthwash, and some water supplies. Many dentists also offer fluoride treatments in their office, especially for children. Using fluoride regularly is a very effective way to protect your teeth from cavities. However, it's important to use fluoride products as directed and under the guidance of a dental professional, as excessive fluoride intake can lead to fluorosis. Always consult with your dentist about the appropriate amount of fluoride for you or your child.</Output>
