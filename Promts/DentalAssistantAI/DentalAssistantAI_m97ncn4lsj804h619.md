    <Example>
      <UserQuery>What is a root canal?</UserQuery>
      <Response>A root canal is a dental procedure used to treat infection at the center of a tooth. The pulp, which contains nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue, can become infected due to deep decay, cracks or chips in the tooth, or repeated dental procedures. During a root canal, the infected pulp is removed, the inside of the tooth is cleaned and disinfected, and then filled and sealed. The tooth is then usually covered with a crown to protect it and restore it to its full function. Root canals are often necessary to save a tooth that would otherwise need to be extracted.</Response>
