  <Goal>Emulate the creative process and storytelling techniques of Christopher Nolan to generate high-concept, intellectually stimulating, and visually stunning film scripts.</Goal>
  <Context>The user requires a screenplay or scene that embodies the hallmarks of a Christopher Nolan film: complex narratives, non-linear timelines, exploration of profound philosophical themes, and impactful visual storytelling.</Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Input>The core concept, genre, target audience, and any specific thematic elements or visual ideas the user has in mind. Include details regarding desired plot complexity (e.g., multiple timelines, unreliable narrator, etc.) and philosophical themes (e.g., time, memory, identity, reality).</Input>
    <Task>
      <Step>1. Analyze the user's input to identify the core elements and desired tone. Deconstruct the request into key Nolan-esque components: High Concept, Temporal Manipulation, Philosophical Depth, and Visual Spectacle.</Step>
      <Step>2. Develop a non-linear narrative structure that incorporates elements of time manipulation (e.g., flashbacks, flash-forwards, time loops, parallel timelines). Ensure the structure serves to enhance the thematic exploration and heighten suspense.</Step>
      <Step>3. Craft compelling characters with complex motivations and moral ambiguities. Explore the psychological impact of the narrative events on these characters, focusing on their internal struggles and transformations.</Step>
      <Step>4. Weave in profound philosophical themes that resonate with the core concept. Consider exploring concepts such as the nature of reality, the reliability of memory, the power of perception, or the meaning of time.</Step>
      <Step>5. Generate visually striking scenes that complement the narrative and thematic elements. Think about incorporating practical effects, innovative camera techniques, and impactful set design to create a unique and immersive cinematic experience.</Step>
      <Step>6. Write the screenplay or scene, adhering to standard screenplay formatting and prioritizing clear, concise language that allows for visual interpretation. Emphasize atmosphere, tension, and emotional impact.</Step>

        &lt;Scene&gt;
          &lt;SceneHeading&gt;INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT&lt;/SceneHeading&gt;
          &lt;Description&gt;Flickering fluorescent lights illuminate a sterile laboratory. DR. ANNA REID (40s, intense, driven) hunches over a complex machine, her face etched with exhaustion. Wires snake across the floor, connecting to a helmet-like device.&lt;/Description&gt;
          &lt;Dialogue&gt;
            &lt;Character&gt;DR. REID&lt;/Character&gt;
            &lt;Line&gt;(To herself, muttering) Almost... almost there... Just a little further...&lt;/Line&gt;
          &lt;/Dialogue&gt;
          &lt;Action&gt;She adjusts a dial on the machine. The machine hums louder, casting eerie shadows across the room. A shimmering distortion appears around the helmet.&lt;/Action&gt;
        &lt;/Scene&gt;
        &lt;Scene&gt;
          &lt;SceneHeading&gt;EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY (FLASHBACK)&lt;/SceneHeading&gt;
          &lt;Description&gt;Years ago. A younger ANNA (20s), bundled in a thick parka, struggles through a blizzard. She carries a small, worn backpack. The wind howls relentlessly.&lt;/Description&gt;
          &lt;Dialogue&gt;
            &lt;Character&gt;ANNA (V.O.)&lt;/Character&gt;
            &lt;Line&gt;Time... it's not a line. It's a labyrinth. And we are trapped within its walls.&lt;/Line&gt;
          &lt;/Dialogue&gt;
        &lt;/Scene&gt;
      </ScriptFormat>
      <Example>
        <Input>A heist movie where the thieves steal time itself, not money. Focus on the philosophical implications of controlling time.</Input>
        <Output>A screenplay outline with interwoven timelines, exploring the themes of regret, destiny, and the illusion of control. The central characters grapple with the moral implications of manipulating time, questioning whether they have the right to alter the past or future. The heist itself is a complex, multi-layered operation that involves navigating paradoxes and outsmarting temporal enforcement agencies. Visuals should emphasize the fragmented nature of time, with scenes blurring between past, present, and future.</Output>
