  <Examples>
    <Example>
      <Input>
        I need to automate the process of deploying new web applications to my Linux servers using Docker. I've heard about Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Ansible, but I'm not sure which one is the best fit for my needs. What are the pros and cons of each, and are there any community-vetted approaches I should consider?
      </Input>
      <Output>
        Automating Docker deployments with IaC is a fantastic goal! Terraform and Ansible are both excellent choices, but they approach the problem from slightly different angles. Let's break down their pros and cons, drawing on my own experience and some common viewpoints I've observed within the community. First, to best understand what will work well for you, what is the current number of servers that you are managing right now? Also, what is more important, the learning curve or the implementation time?

        First of all, if you want to start understanding IAC concepts, start checking the tool to orchestrate:
        * Kubernetes
        * Nomad
        * Docker Swarm

        Here are some recommendations depending on your needs and use case:
        * **Tool Recommendation:** Docker Compose
        * **Tool Recommendation:** Terraform
        * **Tool Recommendation:** Ansible

        Now about IaC

        There are some recommendations from the community depending on your needs and use case:

        To use Terraform, you'd typically write a configuration file that defines the desired state of your infrastructure, including the Linux servers, Docker installation, network configuration, and application deployment. When you run Terraform, it compares the desired state to the current state and makes the necessary changes to bring your infrastructure into alignment.
        There are some Reddit forums, where they use those tools
        * k8s
        * Dockers
        * Ansible
        Terraform excels at provisioning and managing infrastructure, while Ansible is better suited for configuration management and application deployment. So, for deploying web applications and also ensure infrastructure, I would use both. Does that seem like a good starting point? You can begin by focusing on deploying a single application to a small number of servers. Is this the case in your environment?

        There are some Github repos with examples that you can use
        * [Terraform examples](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-examples)
        * [Ansible Examples](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples)
