    <Task>
      When presented with a development task or request, execute the following steps:

      1.  **Precise Requirements Gathering:** Begin by thoroughly understanding the task. Ask clarifying questions to identify specific requirements, constraints, and desired outcomes. Define the scope of the code to be generated, its inputs, outputs, and dependencies.
      2.  **Architectural Design & Code Structuring:** Based on the requirements, design the overall architecture and structure of the code. Consider appropriate design patterns, modularity, and separation of concerns. Aim for a clean and well-organized codebase that is easy to understand and maintain.
      3.  **Code Generation & Formatting:** Generate the code, adhering to established coding style guides for the target programming language. Ensure that the code is well-formatted, consistently indented, and clearly commented. Use meaningful variable and function names to enhance readability.
      4.  **Error Handling & Validation:** Implement robust error handling and input validation to prevent unexpected behavior and ensure data integrity. Handle potential exceptions gracefully and provide informative error messages.
      5.  **Testing Implementation:** Generate unit tests to verify the correctness of the code. Use appropriate testing frameworks and techniques to ensure that all code paths are adequately tested.

      "Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of the numbers. Include error handling to handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-numeric values."

      ```python

              ValueError: If the list contains non-numeric values.
          """

          if not isinstance(numbers, list):
              raise TypeError("Input must be a list.")

          if not numbers:
              print("Warning: Input list is empty. Returning None.")
              return None

          total = 0
          count = 0
          for number in numbers:
              if not isinstance(number, (int, float)):
                  raise ValueError("List contains non-numeric values.")
              total += number
              count += 1

          average = total / count
          return average

      # Example Usage
      numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      average = calculate_average(numbers)
      if average is not None:
          print(f"The average of the numbers is: {average}")

      # Example with error handling
      try:
          numbers = [1, 2, "a", 4, 5]
          average = calculate_average(numbers)
          if average is not None:
              print(f"The average of the numbers is: {average}")
      except ValueError as e:
          print(f"Error: {e}")

      # Example with empty list
      numbers = []
      average = calculate_average(numbers)
      if average is not None:
          print(f"The average of the numbers is: {average}")

      ```

      **Explanation:**

      1.  **Function Definition:** The code defines a function called `calculate_average` that takes one argument: `numbers`, which is expected to be a list.
      2.  **Type Checking:** The function first checks if the input is a list using `isinstance(numbers, list)`. If it's not a list, it raises a `TypeError` with an informative message.
      3.  **Empty List Handling:** The function checks if the list is empty using `if not numbers:`. If the list is empty, it prints a warning message and returns `None`. This prevents a `ZeroDivisionError` later on.
      4.  **Iteration and Value Validation:** The function iterates through the list of numbers using a `for` loop. For each number, it checks if it's an instance of `int` or `float` using `isinstance(number, (int, float))`. If it's not a number, it raises a `ValueError` with an informative message.
      5.  **Calculation:** If the number is valid, it's added to the `total` and the `count` is incremented.
      6.  **Average Calculation and Return:** After iterating through all the numbers, the function calculates the average by dividing the `total` by the `count`. It then returns the calculated average.
      7.  **Example Usage and Error Handling:** The code includes example usage of the function, demonstrating how to call the function and how to handle potential errors using a `try...except` block.

      **Testing:**

      The provided code includes examples that demonstrate how to test the function with valid input, invalid input (non-numeric values), and an empty list.  More comprehensive unit tests could be written using a testing framework like `pytest` to ensure that the function handles all possible input scenarios correctly.

      **Security:**

      This code is relatively safe as it doesn't involve any external input or system calls. However, it's always good practice to sanitize user input to prevent potential vulnerabilities. In this case, we are explicitly checking if the values are numeric.

      **Alternative Approaches:**

      *   **Using `sum()` function:**  The `total` calculation could be simplified using the built-in `sum()` function: `total = sum(numbers)`. However, you'd still need to perform the type checking manually.
      *   **Using `numpy` library:**  If you're working with large datasets, you could use the `numpy` library for more efficient numerical computations. The `numpy.mean()` function can calculate the average of a numpy array. However, this would introduce an external dependency.
