  <Example>
    <UserIssue>
      I'm getting an error when building my .NET Core project in Visual Studio: "The SDK 'Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web' specified could not be found."
    </UserIssue>
    <LogFile>
      ```
      MSBUILD : error MSB4236: The SDK 'Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web' specified could not be found.
      ```
    </LogFile>
    <AgentResponse>
      <ProblemSummary>
        The .NET Core project is failing to build with the error "The SDK 'Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web' specified could not be found."
      </ProblemSummary>
      <LogAnalysis>
        The log file indicates that the 'Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web' SDK is missing.
      </LogAnalysis>
      <RootCause>
        This error typically occurs when the required .NET Core SDK or targeting pack is not installed on the system, or the project file is referencing a SDK that is not installed.
      </RootCause>
      <SolutionSteps>
        <Step number="1">
          **Verify .NET Core SDK Installation:** Check if the .NET Core SDK is installed. Open a command prompt and run `dotnet --info`. Verify that the output shows the installed SDKs.
          <Explanation>
            This command will list all installed .NET Core SDKs on your machine. If the SDK is not listed, you need to install it.
          </Explanation>
        </Step>
        <Step number="2">
          **Install the Required SDK:** If the SDK is missing, download and install the appropriate .NET Core SDK from the official Microsoft website ([https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)). Ensure you install the SDK that matches the target framework of your project.
          <Explanation>
            Download and install the latest version of the .NET Core SDK from the Microsoft website. Ensure that the architecture (x64 or x86) matches your system.
          </Explanation>
        </Step>
        <Step number="3">
          **Check Project File:** Open the `.csproj` file of your project and verify that the `TargetFramework` and `Sdk` attributes are correctly specified. For a web application, it should include `Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web"`.
          <Explanation>
            The project file defines the target framework and SDK used by the project. Ensure that the `TargetFramework` and `Sdk` attributes are correctly specified.
            Example:
            ```xml
            <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
              <PropertyGroup>
                <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
                <Nullable>enable</Nullable>
                <ImplicitUsings>enable</ImplicitUsings>
              </PropertyGroup>
            </Project>
            ```
          </Explanation>
        </Step>
        <Step number="4">
          **Restart Visual Studio:** After installing the SDK, restart Visual Studio to ensure it recognizes the newly installed SDK.
          <Explanation>
            Restarting Visual Studio will refresh the environment variables and ensure that Visual Studio recognizes the newly installed SDK.
          </Explanation>
        </Step>
        <Step number="5">
            **Clean and Rebuild:** In Visual Studio, go to Build -> Clean Solution, then Build -> Rebuild Solution.
            <Explanation>
              This will clear out any cached build artifacts and force Visual Studio to rebuild the project from scratch, ensuring it uses the newly installed SDK.
            </Explanation>
          </Step>
      </SolutionSteps>
      <TroubleshootingTips>
        - Ensure that the `PATH` environment variable includes the .NET Core SDK installation directory.
        - If you have multiple versions of the .NET Core SDK installed, ensure that the correct version is being used by the project. You can specify the SDK version in the `global.json` file.
        - If you are using a build server, ensure that the server has the required .NET Core SDK installed.
      </TroubleshootingTips>
    </AgentResponse>
