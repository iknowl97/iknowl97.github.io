        <Goal>Generate a docker-compose configuration file for setting up Ollama with both main models and embedding models, optimized for local network API access, and integration with n8n.</Goal>
        <Context>The user is an experienced sysadmin familiar with Docker. They want a docker-compose setup that includes Ollama, main models, and embedding models. The Ollama API should be accessible on the local network, and the embedding models should be usable within an n8n workflow.</Context>
        <Instructions>
          <Step>1. **Base Docker-Compose Structure:** Create the basic `docker-compose.yml` file structure, including version, services, and volumes. Start with version '3.8'.</Step>
          <Step>2. **Ollama Service Definition:** Define the `ollama` service. This service should:
            *  Use the official Ollama Docker image (`ollama/ollama`).  Specify the `latest` tag to pull the most up-to-date version of the image
            *  Map port `11434` to the host to expose the Ollama API on the local network. Use format "11434:11434".
            *  Define a volume to persist the models. Mount a volume named `ollama_data` at `/root/.ollama`.
            *  Set the `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable to `0.0.0.0` to allow access from the local network.
            *  Set a restart policy to `always` to ensure the container restarts automatically if it crashes.
          </Step>
          <Step>3. **Volume Definition:** Define the `ollama_data` volume to persist the downloaded models across container restarts. This volume will store the models downloaded by Ollama.
          </Step>
          <Step>4. **Embedding Models Considerations:** Add a comment indicating that specific embedding models need to be downloaded separately via `ollama pull`. Suggest that the user can specify models like `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` or `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text` depending on their n8n workflow requirements.
          </Step>
          <Step>5. **N8n Integration Notes:**  Include a comment explaining how to configure n8n to use the Ollama embedding models.  This involves using the HTTP Request node to send text to the Ollama API (e.g., `http://<ollama-host>:11434/api/embeddings`) and processing the response.
          </Step>
          <Step>6. **Complete docker-compose.yml Content:** Combine all the above steps into a complete, valid `docker-compose.yml` file ready for execution.</Step>
          <Step>7. **Output XML:**  Return the generated `docker-compose.yml` content enclosed within the `<file>` tags. Ensure the content is properly formatted and valid YAML.
          </Step>
        </Instructions>
        <Example>
          <UserInput>I want to run ollama in docker and expose the api to local network, also i will be using embedding models with n8n</UserInput>
          <Response>
            ```xml
            <file>
version: '3.8'
services:
  ollama:
    image: ollama/ollama:latest
    ports:
      - "11434:11434"
    volumes:
      - ollama_data:/root/.ollama
    environment:
      OLLAMA_HOST: 0.0.0.0
    restart: always
volumes:
  ollama_data:
# NOTE: You'll need to pull specific embedding models using `ollama pull`.
#       For example: `ollama pull sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` or `ollama pull nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text`
#       Choose models compatible with your n8n workflows.
#
# To use the embedding models in n8n:
# 1. Use the HTTP Request node.
# 2. Configure the node to send a POST request to `http://<ollama-host>:11434/api/embeddings`.
# 3. Include the following JSON body:
#    { "model": "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2", "prompt": "Your text to embed" }
# 4. Process the response from the API.

            </file>
            ```
          </Response>
        </Example>
        <Considerations>
          - This configuration assumes the user has Docker and Docker Compose installed.
          - The user should replace `<ollama-host>` in the n8n integration instructions with the actual hostname or IP address where the Ollama service is running.  If running n8n and Ollama on the same machine, it will likely be `localhost` or the machine's IP address.  If running them in Docker containers on the same network, using the service name `ollama` might work.
          - The user needs to choose and `ollama pull` the appropriate embedding models based on their specific needs and the capabilities of their n8n workflows.  The example models are just suggestions.
          -  User may want to add resources limit in the compose file based on his infrastructure.
        </Considerations>

  </OriginalPrompt>
  <Goal>To generate a robust and configurable docker-compose file for Ollama, encompassing best practices for network accessibility, data persistence, resource management, and seamless integration with n8n, while also providing clear instructions and considerations for users of varying experience levels with Docker and Ollama.</Goal>
  <Context>The user is a sysadmin with Docker experience seeking a streamlined docker-compose configuration for Ollama. The solution should cater to use cases involving both main and embedding models, facilitate local network API access, and enable integration with n8n for workflow automation. Consider scenarios where n8n and Ollama might reside on the same host or within separate Docker containers on the same network. Address potential challenges related to networking, resource allocation, and model selection. The target audience includes experienced Docker users, but the documentation should be accessible to those with less familiarity.</Context>
  <Instructions>
    <Step>1. **Base Docker-Compose Structure:** Create the fundamental `docker-compose.yml` file structure, specifying version '3.8'.  Include top-level keys: `version`, `services`, and `volumes`.</Step>
    <Step>2. **Ollama Service Definition:** Define the `ollama` service with the following attributes:
      *   Use the official Ollama Docker image (`ollama/ollama:latest`).
      *   Expose port `11434` on the host to enable local network access to the Ollama API (e.g., `11434:11434`).
      *   Mount a volume named `ollama_data` to `/root/.ollama` for persistent storage of models.
      *   Set the `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable to `0.0.0.0` to allow network access.
      *   Configure the restart policy to `always` to ensure automatic container restarts.
      *   **Resource Limits (Optional but Recommended):**  Add resource limits for CPU and memory to prevent Ollama from consuming excessive resources. Example:
          ```yaml
          resources:
            limits:
              cpus: '2'
              memory: 4G
          ```
          Present this as optional, encouraging users to adjust values based on their hardware.
    </Step>
    <Step>3. **Volume Definition:** Define the `ollama_data` volume, ensuring data persistence across container restarts.</Step>
    <Step>4. **Networking Considerations:**  Add a comment block to address networking configurations based on different deployment scenarios:
      *   **Same Host:** If n8n and Ollama are on the same host, accessing the Ollama API via `http://localhost:11434` should work.
      *   **Docker Containers on Same Network:** If n8n and Ollama are in separate Docker containers on the same network, use the Ollama service name (`ollama`) as the hostname (e.g., `http://ollama:11434`).  Consider creating a dedicated Docker network for n8n and Ollama for simplified communication. Example:
          ```yaml
          networks:
            - ollama_network

          services:
            ollama:
              networks:
                - ollama_network
            n8n:  # Assuming an n8n service exists
              networks:
                - ollama_network
          ```
          Add network definition to top level of the compose file.
      *   **Different Networks/Hosts:** If n8n and Ollama are on different networks or hosts, the user will need to use the host's IP address or hostname to access the Ollama API. Ensure that firewalls are configured to allow traffic on port 11434.
    </Step>
    <Step>5. **Embedding Models Configuration:** Provide guidance on selecting and pulling embedding models:
      *   Emphasize the need to download specific embedding models using `ollama pull`.
      *   Suggest popular models like `sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2` and `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text`.
      *   Highlight the importance of choosing models compatible with n8n workflow requirements and provide links to resources explaining model selection criteria.
    </Step>
    <Step>6. **N8n Integration Guide:** Detail the steps to configure n8n to use Ollama embedding models:
      *   Utilize the HTTP Request node in n8n.
      *   Specify a POST request to the Ollama API endpoint (`http://<ollama-host>:11434/api/embeddings`).  Replace `<ollama-host>` with the correct address based on the networking scenario (see Step 4).
      *   Provide an example JSON body for the request, including the `model` and `prompt` parameters:
          ```json
          {
            "model": "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2",
            "prompt": "Your text to embed"
          }
          ```
      *   Explain how to process the API response to extract the embedding vectors.
      *  Explain other option to integrate Ollama with n8n, the usage of the community node that can be found on n8n website.
    </Step>
    <Step>7. **Security Considerations:** Add a comment section highlighting security best practices:
      *   **Authentication:** Remind users that Ollama, by default, does not have authentication. For production environments, consider implementing a reverse proxy with authentication or exploring Ollama's future authentication features.
      *   **Rate Limiting:** Suggest implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse of the Ollama API.
      *   **Firewall:** Ensure that the firewall only allows access to port 11434 from trusted networks.
    </Step>
    <Step>8. **Complete docker-compose.yml Content:** Generate the complete and valid `docker-compose.yml` file, incorporating all the above steps.</Step>
    <Step>9. **Output XML:** Return the complete `docker-compose.yml` content enclosed within the `<file>` tags, ensuring proper formatting and YAML validity.</Step>

# Networking Considerations:
#
# - Same Host: If n8n and Ollama are on the same host, use http://localhost:11434 to access the Ollama API.
# - Docker Containers on Same Network: Use the Ollama service name (ollama) as the hostname: http://ollama:11434.
#   Consider creating a dedicated Docker network for n8n and Ollama.  Example:
#
# networks:
#   ollama_network:
#
# services:
#   ollama:
#     networks:
#       - ollama_network
#   n8n:  # Assuming an n8n service exists
#     networks:
#       - ollama_network
#
# - Different Networks/Hosts: Use the host's IP address or hostname and ensure firewall allows traffic on port 11434.

# Embedding Models:
#
# You need to pull specific embedding models using `ollama pull`.  Examples:
# `ollama pull sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`
# `ollama pull nomic-ai/nomic-embed-text`
#
# Choose models compatible with your n8n workflows.  Refer to documentation for model selection criteria.

# N8n Integration:
#
# 1. Use the HTTP Request node.
# 2. Configure a POST request to http://<ollama-host>:11434/api/embeddings (replace <ollama-host> appropriately).
# 3. Example JSON body:
#    { "model": "sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2", "prompt": "Your text to embed" }
# 4. Process the API response to extract the embedding vectors.
# Alternatively check out the Ollama community node in n8n for easier integration.
#

# Security Considerations:
#
# - Authentication: Ollama, by default, has no authentication. Implement a reverse proxy with authentication for production.
# - Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse.
# - Firewall: Ensure firewall only allows access to port 11434 from trusted networks.
