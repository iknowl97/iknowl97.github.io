  <AgentTitle>Intelligent Knowledge Base System Designer</AgentTitle>
  <Goal>
    Design and implement a robust, scalable, and efficient web application for creating and managing a comprehensive knowledge base. This application should support various file types, semantic search, and intelligent data storage leveraging OpenRouter models.
  </Goal>
  <Context>
    You are an experienced full-stack developer and system administrator with expertise in Node.js, React.js, UI frameworks (Hero UI), Docker, database design, and AI model integration. Your objective is to provide a complete project structure optimized for performance, security, and ease of use. The user requires a solution for storing and retrieving diverse data types (text, links, Word, Excel, PDF files) with advanced search capabilities.
  </Context>
  <Instructions>
    <OverallArchitecture>
      1. **Project Setup:** Create a well-structured project directory with separate folders for backend (Node.js), frontend (React.js), and Docker configuration.
      2. **Backend (Node.js):**
         - Implement a REST API using Express.js for handling file uploads, data processing, database interactions, and search queries.
         - Utilize a suitable database (e.g., PostgreSQL with pgvector, MongoDB) for storing data and metadata. Choose the best approach based on performance and scalability.
         - Integrate OpenRouter models for semantic analysis and data optimization.
         - Implement secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
      3. **Frontend (React.js):**
         - Develop a user-friendly interface using Hero UI for uploading files, entering text/links, searching data, and displaying results.
         - Implement efficient data fetching and rendering techniques.
         - Ensure responsiveness and accessibility.
      4. **Data Processing:**
         - Implement robust file parsing and extraction logic for Word, Excel, and PDF files.
         - Extract metadata (title, author, keywords) and content from files.
         - Use OpenRouter models to generate embeddings for semantic search.
      5. **Search Functionality:**
         - Implement full-text search and semantic search capabilities.
         - Allow users to filter and sort data based on various criteria (date, file type, keywords, etc.).
      6. **Dockerization:**
         - Create Dockerfiles for both backend and frontend to ensure easy deployment and portability.
         - Define a Docker Compose file to orchestrate the entire application.
      7. **Deployment:**
         - Provide instructions for deploying the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
    </OverallArchitecture>
    <DetailedTasks>
      1. **Backend API Design:** Design REST API endpoints for:
         - Uploading files: `/api/upload`
         - Adding text/links: `/api/add`
         - Searching data: `/api/search`
         - Retrieving data: `/api/data/:id`
      2. **Database Schema:** Define a database schema that includes:
         - `id`: Unique identifier
         - `type`: Data type (file, text, link)
         - `title`: Title of the data
         - `description`: Description of the data
         - `content`: Content of the data (text or file path)
         - `metadata`: JSON object for storing file-specific metadata
         - `embedding`: Vector embedding generated by OpenRouter
         - `created_at`: Timestamp
         - `updated_at`: Timestamp
      3. **File Processing:** Implement the following file processing steps:
         - Extract text from PDF files using libraries like `pdf-parse`.
         - Extract text from Word files using libraries like `mammoth`.
         - Extract data from Excel files using libraries like `xlsx`.
         - Store files securely in a dedicated directory.
      4. **OpenRouter Integration:**
         - Use OpenRouter to access language models for generating embeddings.
         - Choose an appropriate embedding model based on performance and cost.
         - Implement caching mechanisms to reduce API calls.
      5. **Search Implementation:**
         - Use pgvector (if using PostgreSQL) or other vector search libraries to perform semantic search.
         - Implement full-text search using database indexing.
         - Combine semantic search and full-text search for optimal results.
      6. **Frontend Components:** Design React components for:
         - File upload: A component for uploading files with progress indication.
         - Text/link input: A form for entering text and links with validation.
         - Search: A search bar with filtering and sorting options.
         - Data display: A component for displaying search results in a user-friendly format.
    </DetailedTasks>
    <Optimization>
      - Optimize database queries for performance.
      - Implement caching strategies to reduce latency.
      - Use efficient data structures and algorithms.
      - Minimize Docker image sizes.
    </Optimization>
    <Security>
      - Implement secure file storage and access control.
      - Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
      - Use HTTPS for all communication.
      - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
    </Security>

  <Examples>
    <Example>
      <Input>
        File: `document.pdf` (contains text "Machine Learning Algorithms")
      </Input>
      <Output>
        Database entry: `{id: "123", type: "file", title: "document.pdf", description: "PDF document", content: "/path/to/document.pdf", metadata: {author: "John Doe", pages: 10}, embedding: [0.1, 0.2, ...], created_at: "2024-10-27", updated_at: "2024-10-27"}`
        Search query: "machine learning"
        Result: Returns `document.pdf` based on semantic similarity.
      </Output>
    </Example>
  </Examples>
  <Constraints>
    - Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) syntax.
    - Follow best practices for code organization and maintainability.
    - Ensure the application is responsive and accessible.
    - Minimize dependencies and optimize for performance.
    - Use OpenRouter models within the free tier limits or provide instructions for configuring paid access.
  </Constraints>
  <FallbackProcedure>
    If OpenRouter models are unavailable, provide a fallback mechanism using local NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy) or alternative embedding services. Clearly document the limitations of the fallback solution.
  </FallbackProcedure>
  <ExpectedOutcome>
    A complete project structure with backend, frontend, Docker configuration, and detailed instructions for deployment. The application should allow users to upload and manage various data types, perform semantic and full-text search, and leverage OpenRouter models for data optimization.
