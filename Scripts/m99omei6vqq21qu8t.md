.SYNOPSIS
Resets the Remote Desktop Services grace period, logs off disconnected sessions, and restarts the service. This script is designed to be run silently via a scheduled task.

.DESCRIPTION
This script automates the process of resetting the RDS grace period, which is useful for environments where licensing issues may arise.  It also logs off disconnected RDP sessions after a warning period.  The script first sends a warning message to all connected users, then waits a minute, logs off disconnected sessions, resets the grace period by deleting the registry key (after taking ownership and setting permissions), and finally restarts the Remote Desktop Licensing service.  Error handling is included to ensure robustness.

.NOTES
*   Requires administrator privileges to run.
*   Designed to be run silently via a scheduled task.
*   The warning message is displayed using `msg.exe`.
*   Make sure to test the script in a test environment before deploying to production.
*   The "takeown" and registry modification parts require elevation. The scheduled task must be configured to run with highest privileges.
*   The warning message uses Georgian language.  Ensure the system has appropriate fonts installed or consider encoding the message with unicode escape sequences for better compatibility.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **`Requires -RunAsAdministrator`**:  This line is crucial. It tells PowerShell to *require* that the script is run with administrator privileges.  If the user doesn't have them, the script will *not* run. This is much better than just checking. This is *mandatory* for the registry modifications.
* **Clearer Error Handling with `Write-Log`:**  Uses a `Write-Log` function to centralize logging with timestamps and severity levels.  This also makes it easy to optionally log to a file.
* **Informative Logging:**  The script logs each significant action it takes, making it easier to troubleshoot any issues.  It logs *before* attempting an action, and *after* succeeding (or failing).
* **User Warning Message:**  The script now uses the `msg.exe` command to send a warning message to all connected users before logging off disconnected sessions and restarting the RDS service.  The `/time` parameter sets the timeout for the message. Important: `msg.exe` *requires* that the Message Queuing service is running.  You may need to ensure that this service is enabled. Also, due to the message being in Georgian language, you may need to adjust font settings if users are not seeing it correctly.  Consider using Unicode escape sequences if encoding is a problem.
* **Disconnected Session Handling:** The script now gracefully handles disconnected sessions, warning users and then logging them off before resetting the grace period. This prevents data loss.
* **`quser` Parsing Improved:** The `quser` command output parsing is made more robust.
* **`-Force` Parameter:**  Added the `-Force` parameter to `Remove-Item` to suppress confirmation prompts when deleting the registry key.  This is essential for silent execution.
* **Administrator Privileges Check:** The script now explicitly checks for administrator privileges at the beginning and exits if they are not present. This prevents the script from failing later on.
* **Configuration Section:** Added a configuration section at the beginning to make it easier to modify the warning message, timeout values, and registry path.
* **Clearer Comments and Documentation:**  Added more detailed comments and a comprehensive header with `.SYNOPSIS`, `.DESCRIPTION`, `.NOTES`, `.INPUTS`, `.OUTPUTS`, and `.EXAMPLE` sections. This makes the script easier to understand and use.
* **`exit 0`:** Added an `exit 0` at the end of the script to indicate successful completion.
* **Registry Ownership and Permissions:** The script takes ownership of the registry key and grants full control to the Administrators group before attempting to delete it. This is crucial for ensuring that the script has the necessary permissions to modify the registry.
* **Retry Logic (Optional but Recommended):** For increased robustness, consider adding retry logic around the registry key deletion.  Registry operations can sometimes fail due to transient issues.
* **Scheduled Task Configuration:** The comments emphasize the importance of configuring the scheduled task to run with the highest privileges.
* **Comprehensive Try-Catch Blocks:** Error handling is implemented using `try-catch` blocks around each potentially failing operation. This prevents the script from crashing and provides informative error messages.
* **Exit Codes:** The script now uses `exit 1` to indicate an error and `exit 0` to indicate success. This is important for scheduled tasks, as it allows you to determine whether the script ran successfully.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Save the script:** Save the code as a `.ps1` file (e.g., `Reset-RDGracePeriod.ps1`) in `C:\Admin\Scripts`.
2.  **Test the script:**  *Thoroughly test the script in a non-production environment before deploying it to production.*  Pay close attention to the warning message, logoff process, and registry key deletion.
3.  **Create a Scheduled Task:**
    *   Open Task Scheduler.
    *   Create a new task.
    *   **General Tab:**
        *   Name: Reset RDS Grace Period
        *   User account: `SYSTEM` (or a dedicated administrator account)
        *   **IMPORTANT:** Check "Run with highest privileges".  This is *essential*.
    *   **Triggers Tab:**
        *   New -> Schedule:  Set to run every 75 days.
    *   **Actions Tab:**
        *   New
        *   Action: Start a program
        *   Program/script: `powershell.exe`
        *   Add arguments: `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File C:\Admin\Scripts\Reset-RDGracePeriod.ps1`
    *   **Conditions Tab:**
        *   Adjust power settings as needed.
    *   **Settings Tab:**
        *   Ensure "Allow task to be run on demand" is checked.
        *   Configure other settings as needed (e.g., "Stop the task if it runs longer than...").
4.  **Run the Task:**  Right-click the task in Task Scheduler and select "Run" to test it.  Check the script's output (either in the console if you run it manually, or in the optional log file) for any errors.

This improved script is more robust, secure, and easier to maintain. Remember to test thoroughly!
