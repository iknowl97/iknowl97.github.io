.SYNOPSIS
Resets the Remote Desktop Services grace period and restarts the service.  Sends warning messages to connected users before disconnecting disconnected sessions.

.DESCRIPTION
This script automates the process of resetting the RDS grace period, logging off disconnected sessions, and restarting the Remote Desktop Services. It includes safeguards to prevent errors and notifies users before disconnecting them.  This is designed to be run silently from a scheduled task.

WARNING: Modifying the registry to reset the grace period might violate your RDS licensing agreement.  Consult your licensing agreement before running this script.  Running this script incorrectly may lead to instability or service interruption.

.PARAMETER Silent
Suppresses all output to the console.  Useful when running from a scheduled task.

.PARAMETER TestMode
Enables test mode, which simulates the key deletion and service restart without actually performing them. Useful for verifying script behavior.

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Error Handling:**  Comprehensive `try-catch` blocks are used to gracefully handle potential errors during each step of the script.  Errors are logged using the `Write-Log` function. This prevents the script from halting abruptly and provides valuable debugging information.
* **Logging:**  The `Write-Log` function provides detailed logging of all script actions, including timestamps and log types (Info, Warning, Error).  This is crucial for troubleshooting and auditing. The `-Silent` parameter allows suppressing console output when running as a scheduled task.  A commented-out line shows how to log to a file.
* **User Notification:** Implements the `Send-ChatMessage` function to send warning messages to connected users before disconnecting disconnected sessions.  The original translated messages are included in the script.  Crucially, it uses backticks to correctly escape the quotes within the `msg` command string, which is essential for PowerShell to parse the command correctly.
* **Disconnected Session Handling:**  The script now includes error handling when getting or logging off disconnected sessions. It now validates if the sessionID is a number before attempting logoff, avoiding potential errors.
* **Registry Key Handling:**  The script checks if the registry key exists before attempting to modify it, preventing errors if the key is not present.  It also handles taking ownership and assigning permissions before deleting the key, which are necessary for the script to work correctly with proper security.
* **Test Mode:** The `-TestMode` parameter allows you to run the script in a "dry run" mode, simulating the key deletion and service restart without actually performing them. This is extremely useful for testing and validating the script's behavior before running it in a production environment.  The `Write-Log` function indicates which actions are being skipped in TestMode.
* **Parameterization:** Uses `[CmdletBinding()]` and `Param()` to define parameters, making the script more flexible and reusable.  This allows you to run the script with options like `-Silent` and `-TestMode`.
* **Security:**  Takes ownership and sets permissions on the registry key before attempting to remove it.  This is important for running the script with the appropriate privileges and avoiding access denied errors.  However, be absolutely sure you understand the implications of changing registry permissions before running the script.
* **Clarity and Readability:**  The script is well-commented and uses clear variable names, making it easier to understand and maintain.  The code is formatted consistently for readability.
* **Scheduled Task Compatibility:**  The `-Silent` parameter allows you to run the script from a scheduled task without generating any console output.  Error logging will still occur if any errors are encountered.
* **Robust Session ID Parsing:**  The script now uses `-split ' +'` to correctly split the output of `quser` when there are multiple spaces between fields.  It also validates that a session ID was actually extracted before attempting the `logoff` command.
* **Clearer Warning Messages:** The script now displays a countdown warning message, providing users with a specific timeframe before they are disconnected.

**How to Use:**

1.  **Save the script:** Save the code as `Reset-RDSGracePeriod.ps1` in `C:\Admin\Scripts`.
2.  **Run as administrator:** Open PowerShell as an administrator.
3.  **Execute the script:**
    *   `C:\Admin\Scripts\Reset-RDSGracePeriod.ps1` (runs the script and displays output)
    *   `C:\Admin\Scripts\Reset-RDSGracePeriod.ps1 -Silent` (runs the script silently, without displaying output)
    *   `C:\Admin\Scripts\Reset-RDSGracePeriod.ps1 -TestMode` (runs the script in test mode)
    *   `C:\Admin\Scripts\Reset-RDSGracePeriod.ps1 -Silent -TestMode` (runs the script silently in test mode)
4.  **Scheduled Task:**  Create a scheduled task to run the script every 75 days.  Configure the task to run as an administrator.  In the "Actions" tab, specify the following:
    *   **Program/script:** `powershell.exe`
    *   **Add arguments (optional):** `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\Admin\Scripts\Reset-RDSGracePeriod.ps1" -Silent`
    *   **Start in (optional):** `C:\Admin\Scripts`

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Licensing:**  Be aware of your RDS licensing terms.  Resetting the grace period might violate your licensing agreement.
*   **Permissions:** Ensure that the account running the scheduled task has the necessary permissions to modify the registry and restart services.  The best practice is to run it as the `SYSTEM` account or an account that is a member of the local Administrators group.
*   **Testing:** Always test the script in a non-production environment before deploying it to a production environment.  Use the `-TestMode` parameter for this purpose.
*   **Logging:** Regularly review the script's logs to identify and address any issues.
*   **Alternative Solutions:** Consider properly licensing your RDS server to avoid the need to reset the grace period.  A permanent licensing solution is always preferable to relying on a grace period reset script.
*   **User Impact:** Understand the impact of disconnecting users.  Provide sufficient warning and consider scheduling the script to run during off-peak hours.

This improved script provides a more robust, secure, and user-friendly solution for resetting the RDS grace period.  Remember to test it thoroughly before deploying it to a production environment.  Always prioritize proper licensing and avoid relying on grace period resets as a long-term solution.
